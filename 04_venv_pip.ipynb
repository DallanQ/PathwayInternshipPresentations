    "- There is an even better way to manage virtual environments and dependencies than venv and pip, and it's called `poetry`. It's a bit more complicated than venv and pip so we won't learn about it right away, but we will learn about it in a few months. I use venv and pip for simple projects and `poetry` for larger projects."
