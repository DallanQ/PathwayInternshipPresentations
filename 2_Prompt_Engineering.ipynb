    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a relatively new development in computing. They have been fed billions of pages of content from the Internet, books, and other places. As a result, they can understand and respond to natural-language instructions. Because of this, you don't need to learn a specialized programming language to get an LLM to do what you want. *Programming* an LLM is a matter of learning the best way to give it instructions so its responses are the most accurate. Nobody knows exactly how best to instruct an LLM. It's often a matter of trial and error, but people are discovering ideas that seem to work well generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two courses will give you an overview of various things you can use to program LLMs for your own work."
