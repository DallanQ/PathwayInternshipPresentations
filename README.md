# PathwayInternshipPresentations
Presentations for the Pathway Internships

I will create prentation notebooks outlining what we will cover each week. 
I'll try to create them at least a week ahead of time so people can go over them early if they want.
 
* Week 1: Install software, learn bash, get familiar with node and python

* Week 2: Git and AI

* Weeks 3+4: Take courses in Front-end or Back-end development

* Week 5: Get to know the software behind https://iloveconference.org, and Individual presentations

* Weeks 6-26: To be determined
