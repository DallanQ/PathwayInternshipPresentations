# PathwayInternshipPresentations
Presentations for the Pathway Internships

I will create prentation notebooks outlining what we will cover each week. 
I'll try to create them at least a week ahead of time so people can go over them early if they want.
 
* Week 1: Install software, learn bash, get familiar with node and python

* Week 2: Learn Prompt Engineering

* Week 3: AI and Git

* Weeks 4+5: Take courses advancing your skills in Front-end or Back-end development

* Week 6: Introduction to Frameworks for Front-end or Back-end development

* Week 7: Deeper-dive into Frameworks, and Agile project management methodology

* Weeks 8-26: Work on real-world projects
