    "## Hybrid search example\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid search means to index each node twice: once with a dense embedding usual, and also with a \"sparse\" embedding. \n",
    "Hybrid search is especially important when queries contain specific keywords instead of just context. \n",
    "For example, we don't want to get results for Joseph Smith or Martin Harris for a query about Oliver Cowdery, even if their embeddings turn out to be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several popular sparse embeddings:\n",
    "- BM25 - embedding contains a column for every possible word in the index, with the value being the number of times the word appears in the node\n",
    "- Splade - you can think of this as being similar to BM25, but nodes also have non-zero numbers for synonyms of the words they contain\n",
    "- BGE-M3 - this is a new embedding model that supports both dense and sparse embeddings: https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Milvus index, hosted at Zilliz, which uses BGE-M3. \n",
    "To use Zilliz, you need to create a free account at https://zilliz.com/ start a cluster, \n",
    "and copy the cluster URI and TOKEN into your .env file as MILVUS_URI and MILVUS_TOKEN respectively.\n",

Players assume the roles of Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, who are lost in a strange world on their steamship, the Manticore. The game involves exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods to return home. The game is both an atlas and a storybook game, with each page of the atlas and each new location offering different adventures, treasures, and characters. \n",
      "\n",
      "The gameplay involves equipping ability cards to crew members, spending command tokens to activate abilities, and overcoming challenges. Each crew member can have a total of 2 equipped ability cards at once. Combat rounds are also a part of the game, where players use their combat action tokens to attack enemies. The game concludes when all crew member health is reduced to zero or if the ship takes 11 damage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The game also includes a campaign mode where players can save their progress and continue at a later time. However, the game can only support one campaign at a time. The game concludes with a final score based on various factors like adventure cards, quest cards, level cards, remaining coins, and remaining artifacts.\n"
