    "**Agile** is a project management methodology, or a way to manage projects, that is very common in software development. We will use Agile during the rest of the internship. I believe this will help you be more productive as well as learn an important new skill. "

    "3. Deliver projects frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.\n",
    "4. Coordinating team members must work together daily throughout the project.\n",
    "5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.\n",
    "6. Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within different teams."

    "11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n",
    "12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."
