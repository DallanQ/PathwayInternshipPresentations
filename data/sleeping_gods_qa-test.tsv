https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855483/exploring-while-traveling	Mac's +1 to fate to fate draw - can this be used during other players' or crew members' fate draws during combat?	I use it for anyone participating in combat, but I may be wrong?...? Yes.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3067118/are-you-forced-to-spend-artifacts-as-coins	Are you forced to spend artifacts as coins?	I would play it that If you only have artifacts, then you have no coins to lose. This. Artifacts are worth coins, they are not coins.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879442/a-bunch-of-questions	During a turn, can a non-turn player pay the command token cost to activate one of the shared adventure cards?	Yes	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2739037/watchful-laurent-level-card	"Can I only use the ability if I draw 4 tokens (3 plus the ""extra"")? Or can I draw 1 token and stop an then draw the ""extra"" one?"	You can choose to draw only one token and use the ability to draw another ignoring the damage in it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3135448/when-giving-unused-combat-action-tokens-who-gets-t	When giving unused combat action tokens, who gets the token back at the start of the next round?	Just for the round. Next round, each player gets their combat markers back.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018188/using-multiple-crew-abilities-allowed-or-just-one	Using multiple crew abilities allowed or just one at a time?	Correct. You have to clear the command token before using an ability on that crew member again	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	can someone have more than one level card or just one per character (so if already had one they would discard it to replace with new one)	why not ?	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2894053/duplicating-actionsabilities	If on Action 1 I explore a location and receive some reward, can I simply explore the same location for Action 2 and receive the same reward? And do it again on a subsequent turn (perhaps the very next one)? If yes, is that even true in a case where there are no complexities like keywords or challenges, and therefore the outcome is guaranteed to be the same? Rules seem to permit this, thought it doesn't seem logical.	Yes, you can explore again for you second action, but be aware that most locations give you cards with keywords preventing you claiming strong rewards more than once.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604720/enemy-cards-clarification	Why is the body empty? Does that mean I can still put a damage on there in order to get to an adjacent spot?	"The body is empty because damage must be applied in a continuous ""swipe,"" so it makes it more difficult to swipe those effects away. You're allowed to place markers in the blanks, they're just effort/damage sinks, in a manner of speaking. Game mechanics wise, it's empty to present a puzzle of how to mark off all the hearts. Canonically, the explanation might be something like this enemy's body isn't an important part to incapacitate them. Yes, you can put a damage in any box, even if empty, and may have to when trying to reach other more important boxes."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035910/setup-question-give-each-player-1-command-and-one	Where do they go? Back to the adventure deck? What stops you from going back and getting that again?	The one we encountered I think we put it back in the deck. And if my memory is correct it did not have a keyword that would prevent you from going back and getting it again but this would be a little costly in terms of time to do that over and over again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	an ability card can be equipped at any time except middle of combat or challenge. So does that imply that the combat or challenge process has started and then can’t be equipped? Or if we say see that we're fighting a particular monster or challenge, but before we actually begin the process of assigning characters or drawing fate etc, we can still equip ability card.	BEFORE you know what the challenge or the combat will be you can not add a savvy card for this savvy challenge...	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2676516/can-you-assign-damage-to-any-character-from-a-end	Can you assign damage to any character from a end of round monster counterattack?	Counterattacks must be against the crew who attacked, but end of the round damage can be assigned to anyone. (RB page 24).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	Final scoring, which cards?	Seems that Market cards (including starting Gloria etc.) are COUNTED for final scoring. Adventure cards are also gained through scenario book and are worth 2 points. Some of Adventure cards are Totems. Those are worth 4 points	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248418/if-i-equip-a-weapon-to-my-crew-can-i-equip-other-c	If I equip a weapon to my crew, can I equip other crew members with that weapon whenever I want?	"according to rulebook p.29 - not in combat""You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only the weapon info is showing""I think that same rule also apply to totem weapons. believe you can switch which character is using a weapon at any time outside of combat. Once combat begins, you cannot make any changes."	You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only theweapon info is showing.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2790265/end-of-event-deck-procedure	So, if you succeed, do not restore crew health, is that correct?	That's correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2798520/using-non-active-audrie-to-travel-need-to-pay-1-co	Let’s say I got an ability card with perception skill which gives you +2 accuracy (or +2 defense) when you discard it.If I’m playing with captain and I discard this equipped card to get +2 accuracy in combat, then can I get 1 plus damage as well? On the rule book it says ‘you may discard 1 equipped when you attack with this weapon’ but I’m not sure if it means I should discard the card when I’m dealing the damage or I can discard it anytime in a combat round. Also Am i allowed to discard equipped card more than 1 (2cards) at the same time?	You cannot discard a card for two things at the same time. If you discard your ability card for +2 accuracy, that's all you get. If you discard it to get +1 damage with the captain's rifle, that is all you get.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	Does it only work once in combat, or does it stay active until that combat is over?	All abilities are one time use. Note that on ability cards the command token goes back to the supply. So you can keep using them if you have more command tokens. Adventure cards/Market Cards and crew abilities, the command tokens stay on the card and cannot be used again until the tokens are cleared from them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	"Specifically Challenges and applying status tokens. It says ""your"", but since other players can contribute characters to a challenge by spending a command, I assume they can also be the target of a status token. Bigger question is if no characters participate in the challenge and a status token needs to be placed, can it go on another player's character?"	"Context is important, but it normally means the crew which one player controls. For example, Rulepop says: ""If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped."" Was there a specific use case or rulebook sentence to which you were referring?"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3038373/when-to-apply-fatigue	On what occasions does a character get a fatigue token?	It's pretty much just participating in a Challenge that causes fatigue. If you want a character to help, and apply their traits to the Challenge they get 1 fatigue (max 2). Everything else, like participating in combat, using a character's skills on their board, resolving events, explore actions... None of these cause fatigue unless the game specifically tells you it's a consequence of the action you just took. And when that's the case it will be very clear about it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3059554/what-to-do-when-placing-tokens-already-covered	What to do when placing tokens already covered?	No, you cannot place damage on a square that already has damage. Step 4 explains the rule here: https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#attack-counterattack	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904319/sleeping-gods-as-an-action-question	"Certain negative ongoing events in Sleeping Gods state on their cards that ""as an action"" one may attempt a certain challenge (e.g., a STRENGTH 7 check) to remove the event.Does this mean that you can try using up one of your two actions at the final part of your turn to attempt this challenge and remove the event? Or, does it mean you can attempt the challenge once per turn at will on your turn (without using up either of your usual two actions) to try and get rid of the event?"	It's the first one - it uses one of your 2 actions in your turn to attempt the challenge to overcome it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2877146/changing-player-count-mid-campaign	Discard 1 ability card from hand? Or from one of their characters? What happens if there are no cards in that player’s hand to discard?	"Since it doesn't say an ""equipped ability card"", then it's a card in hand. If there's no card in hand, then I imagine it's fine. Part of the reason you're discarding a card and all but 1 command is because removing a player may end up dropping you pass the threshold to flip the board---board costs and rewards have different values for lower player counts."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855502/cooking-flapjacks-clarification-needed	"I see that the ""Flapjacks"" card has an ability to remove 3 x health tokens and 3 x fatigue tokens from a crew member. My question is, can I split that to heal one character while removing fatigue from another? Or does the card collectively apply to only one crew member?"	Fortunately for you, it's neither of those!  You can remove any 3 fatigue and damage tokens you'd like, from any characters and in any combination.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2721403/synergy-tokens-on-a-miss	Say I attack with the captain who has another crewmember's +1 damage synergy token. I miss. Therefore, I take the counterattack from the monster and then normally am allowed to deal one damage. Can I use the synergy token to add damage, even though I missed?	"Yes, you can. The rule says: ""Missing: If you miss, you still get to deal 1 damage, after the enemy counterattack (you deal 0 damage in this case if you have 2 fatigue). Abilities that increase attack damage can be used even if you miss.""You can check a particular rule quickly in this awesome online guide: https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#attack-counterattack"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640098/cooking-questions	With Alzarrian Cook Book, would I be able to use cake for 1 command and no grain, to remove 2 low morale and remove 2 fatigue?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2660172/running-out-of-status-tokens	What should we do if instructed to gain a status, but all the matching tokens are already on your crew?	Because of the limited components rule, nothing happens: rules pg. 8 Limited ComponentsAll components are limited, which means that if you run out, you cannot gain or use more, with one exception: damage tokens. If you run out of damage tokens, use something else to keep track.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2813941/final-score-do-you-count-unlocked-quest-cards	Do you count unlocked Quest cards?	The rules say to count Adventure cards, it doesn't make exceptions for the starting cards or the campaign upgrades - so I just include them in the tally.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611947/question-regarding-audries-distract-ability	Does a dead enemy still count as adjacent?	Dead enemies are removed and the gaps closed as soon as you kill said enemy.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3271748/i-have-2-questions-about-combat-one-is-about-allow	Can you place 4 damage in a square shaped pattern? Or would one of these placements be diagonally and not allowed?	4 damage in a square is ok. Place the first one top left, then top right, then bottom right, then bottom left.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2628956/revisiting-sites-and-totems-in-a-new-campaign	Are you allowed to search for a Totem you found in a previous Campaign if its ability is worth going after (assuming you obtain the correct keyword first)?	Yes	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879442/a-bunch-of-questions	Can you choose to do less than the designated amount of damage?	No	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2776331/what-order-are-enemies-supposed-to-be-arranged	What order are enemies supposed to be arranged?	Shuffle the cards you just retrieved and place them face up in a row in the center of the table, without any space between cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3016298/why-do-you-get-less-command-tokens-if-playing-with	Why do you get less command tokens if playing with fewer players.	When you help another player for a challenge, i.e., use one of your character's icons for a challenge during another player's turn, you need to pay a command. Same if you want to give one of your combat cubes to another player. This obviously happens more often with more players.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844043/newb-questions	What do I do with completed event cards? Do I just have a discard pile of them? When I create the event deck the second (and third times) do I shuffle each time, or do the exact same order?	On the event deck, yes. Just start a discard pile. At the event at the end of each time through the desk you will get instructions on how to remake it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905797/covering-squares-in-combat	In order to cover a square, is it enough one damage for all except for hearts with numbers?	Yes you only need to do 1 damage to cover up a 3 attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Are recipes reusable? or are only a 1 time use?	They're reusable.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	Should specify if we can add cards after the result of the draw or not (ex. if I draw a 3 fate card may I still discard a Ability card to make it 4?)	"Yes, you can. It's mentioned on p.13 ""Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total."" The ""add 1 per card to the total"" is clear to me. And it is even more clearly described in the Challenges section on p.19"	Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005442/accuracy-abilities-vs-fate-abilities-and-redraw-fa	Can I use adventure card fate abilities here as well? Can I spend a command token on gear to redraw fate instead?	Yes you can use adventure card abilities after drawing Fate to modify the outcome.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248832/if-the-enemy-counterattacks-after-failing-to-attac	If the enemy counterattacks after failing to attack, you can deal 1 damage to the enemy again. Even if the attack is successful, will the enemy counterattack and then deal 1 damage to the enemy again?	If the attack is successful, then you don't deal an additional damage. The additional damage is only if you miss on your attack.	
 	Does each wing symbol on an enemy card prevent a hit if no ranged weapon is used? Or is the number of wings irrelevant?	"1. The number is irrelevant 2. Wings do not prevent a hit; it makes enemies more difficult to hit: ""Enemies with a wing symbol have the flying ability, which means they have +1 defense against any weapons that do not have the “ranged” attribute:"". So an enemy with Defense 5 and one or more Wings would have Defense 6 against weapons without the 'Ranged' keyword."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3021808/can-a-crew-member-have-the-same-ability-card-equip	Can a crew member have the same ability card equipped twice?	you can have the same card equipped if you paid for it. nothing in the rules states otherwise or impose any kind of limits.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3200835/owning-quest-cards	How One is owning quest cards? If i complete or lose quests do I loose the keyword?	Yes, you would lose the given keyword in those cases. The keyword is active as long as the according quest card is active.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2971238/what-means-the-plus-before-the-accuracy-number-ob	Is there an official ruling/FAQ?	This was answered in another thread here. You can only use one character but other players may discard ability cards. And any player may spend command to action cards to augment the challenge as normal.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3024266/what-to-keep-for-next-campaign-minor-spoilers	What to keep for next campaign? [Minor SPOILERS]	New campaign is starting over in an alternate timeline. You don’t keep totems or experience and everyone starts out again. You do unlock some bonus options depending on how many totems you found though.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844043/newb-questions	Brenna said in other threads that it can be to any character, not just the ones you control.	Yes, to any of the characters you control.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794921/quest-clarification	Does this mean that Mac is unavailable, not on the ship, can’t help during combat, etc, until the crew goes to this cabin and gets her?	No, unless a quest or part of the storybook specifically says a character is unavailable then they are available. I've only run across one such case and it was very clear. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2639686/location-122	Can you only enter from page 16?	Yes, you can only enter from page 16, but it doesn't need to be from the upper left corner. Anytime you follow the arrow to another page, you can enter from any region on that side of the page.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690600/lose-food-but-no-food-unfulfilled-demand-eg-rotten	What happens when you are instructed to lose food but your supply is lower than the amount you are told to lose?	If you only have 1 food and you are told to lose 2 for example, you just lose 1 food. In the case of unfulfilled demand, like with Rotten Supplies, if you have no food, you can argue thematically that there was no fungus to begin with, so it's okay to throw out all 0 food.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677204/search-token-question	In the rule book it says to apply any damage you find when you use the deck. Does this also apply to the low morale token with the coin? Or do you only apply damage? 	Yes, the designer has confirmed that somewhere - all negative consequences of all revealed tokens are applied, including low morale.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	Can you use a card's ability and then also discard it for an additional effect?	Yes, it was clarified that you could use a card's ability, and then also discard it for an additional effect. For example, with Adrenaline, it could give you +1 damage if you have taken 3 or more damage, and you could then discard it for the icon to get an additional +1 damage if using a matching weapon for a total of 5.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904637/travel-test	If I'm not successful on a test I receive the penalty. But I still proceed normally with the instructions right? Or in the case of travel on a hazard place, for example, I would still move there right?	Correct. Negative effects are applied and then you proceed normally.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598711/can-you-use-recipes-in-combat	Can you use Recipes in Combat	There is an explicit rule preventing this. Page 18 under activate adventure cards: While in combat, you cannot cook recipes or activate adventure cards that allow you to move the ship.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623494/quests-12-and-coins	Is there any official denomination for what the bigger coins stand for?	The coins are 5's.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2849626/regular-challenges-vs-travel-challenges	So in every other respect, it's just like a regular challenge?	Yes, in every other respect, it's just like a regular challenge. Crew board abilities, ability card abilities, adventure card abilities from both players are allowed, as well as ability card discarding from both players. The only difference is the limitation on crew members.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	 Crew members with 2 fatigue cannot participate to a challenge. But can we use crew abilities or equipped ability cards of the exhausted crew members to alter the outcomes of the fate draw?	You can use crew abilities, but not equipped ability cards. Those only count if the crew member gains fatigue. You can, of course, discard ability cards from your hand to help.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2574093/ship-action-clarification	Before the ship action I have one command left in the pool. I place the worker on the bridge to draw 2 command and place all used command back in the pool. Is this action draw 2 then return all or is it a simultaneous action?	"On page 10 of the rulebook it states ""Ship action effects can be applied in any order"". So you would be able to return all the used command to the pool then take 2."	Ship action effects can be applied in any order.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3254605/discard-activity-cards	Can you discard cards during any challenge to increase your success?	Yes, any player may discard any number of ability cards from their hands to add the associated skill to the challenge.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2819777/what-to-do-if-ship-has-all-but-1-damage-spot-left	What to do if ship has all but 1 damage spot left open?	If you cannot take an action because all rooms have 2 damage, move the ship action figure to one of the rooms, but take no ship action	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611195/end-of-round-can-all-monsters-attack-the-same-char	What about the armour with block that you can buy - does that affect all attacks?	Yes as per page 24, you can apply block from adventure cards, crew abilities or block that applies 'end of round enemy attack'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3157128/how-to-deal-with-results-of-a-challenge-if-no-char	If you're referring to the hearts in the grid with a number in it, what does that mean?	That means that you have to inflict X damage in order to cover it. You just place 1 damage token, not subtract X damage from your total damage value (which means even with Y damage, where Y>X, you're not placing Y damage tokens, for example if you make 3 damage, but use 2 of that to cover up a heart with a 2, you're only placing one more damage token).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601437/a-smattering-of-post-play-questions-search-tokens	How much of the fail/success criteria of an option should be read before making a decision?	You absolutely do read success/fail text before making your decisions, knowing the consequences of failure is important information for deciding how much to invest in a challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844043/newb-questions	How do I assign damage in instances like this, where there has not been a challenge?	Yes, to any of the characters you control.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879442/a-bunch-of-questions	Is there anything in the rules that stop you from farming a location that gives you resources?	"In a non city location, you are usually instructed to return to the ship. So you can farm as long as you're willing to spend time on it, unless a keyword tells you otherwise obviously (like if you get the first time, get resources and the keyword ""NOMORERESOURCES"", and the next time you go there it tells you ""if you do not have the keyword NOMORERESOURCES""). The only thing that stops you from farming a location is the time limit of the game. You will go through the event deck a certain amount of times until the game ends. Wasting precious time farming a location won't do you any good. Keep in mind though, you are only allowed to pick each option once PER explore option. So lets say you have the choices: A. Buy goods (pay 1 coin, gain 1 grain) B. Sell goods (pay 1 grain, gain 1 coin) C. Return to the ship. You can not stay there buying/selling as much as you want. The most you can do is buy once, sell once, then return to the ship."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3006772/does-venom-activate-outside-of-combat-as-well	If untreated, will venom continue to -1 health on each players turn OUTSIDE of combat?	yes	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533113/block-and-weapons	I'm still confused. Could You clarify? Block from equipment cards adds to a block from weapons or no?	They are separate, so you can use both. Weapons can only block counterattacks, and you can only use 1 weapon (either printed on the character board or already equipped to that character before combat). Equipment can be used to block counterattacks and end-of-round attacks, but usually costs command to use.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2790265/end-of-event-deck-procedure	So in theory, instead of placing two fatigue tokens, I can just flip one over. I am just thinking to save space on the character boards.	Yes, but then you wouldn't be able to save your game, which is why the rules exist as they are. If you packed your crew boards away with all their tokens, then the next time you took them out you wouldn't know which side the token was supposed to be on. If there are two tokens, you quickly know how much fatigue your crew member has. But if you'd rather use a different method for saving, or if you're just leaving your game set up, that's totally fine. That's just the reasoning behind why the rules are the way they are.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2540037/arrow-icon-on-weapons	Does anyone know what the arrow icon on weapons like Twine’s Harpoon and Owens’ Derringer mean?	 Those are ranged weapons. It will only matter when you are facing flying monsters where non-ranged weapons will have reduced effectiveness.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2994999/replaying-event-locations	It seems there are some numbered locations that you can visit again and again. I'm wondering if I'm missing something or if there is something missing with the translation of the game (I have the french edition) because sometimes it doesn't make sense. For instance: on location 6 (p14 of the map book): You find a recently abandonned camp you can either loot or wait for the camper to come back. First time I went there, I waited, the group came back and they were mad at me and I run away with a coin. If I go there a second time, nothing tells me that something has changed. I can just do the same thing again or choose the other option, and the same groupe come back again? That's a bit weird	Yes, you can repeat it. The things you can't repeat are controlled by keywords on the quest cards.The question is 'is it worth it'?You only have a limited number of turns to complete your campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2898953/dungeon-item-hearthcoal-move-ship-3-distance	Should this item be used as part of the Travel action, or can it be used any time assuming it does not cost an action?	The latter seems the intended use of this item.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3038359/clarification-of-action-travel	Have I read this incorrectly? It appears to be a clear contradiction. Are you able to have more than one crew member participate in Action: Travel or not? It states in bold you can only choose one then on the next page gives an example of participating 2. Apologies if I have misinterpreted or misread this. Thanks a lot!	I believe the rule on Page 13 is referring to the travel action itself, which you may only choose one additional crewmember to participate (if they have a craft skill). This is to determine how many spaces the Manticore ship may move. However, the example on Page 14, Travel Example 2 is referring to a challenge that was encountered as a result of travelling, and any number of crew members may participate in a challenge (or none at all).

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2727593/clarification-on-spolier-at-location-40	So, does everyone heal 6 damage, or is it 6 health in total, among the crew?	It's 6 total. You can tell the second part affects each crew member individually because it specifies ALL status tokens on ALL crew members. If there's nothing in the text that specifies, healing always applies across the whole crew and not per crew member.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022338/when-monsters-atack	If the event deck runs out while discarding, what should be done?	Count the remaining event cards you need to discard and place an equal number of damage on the event deck slot. The damage is placed here to remind you how many cards you must discard the next time the storybook instructs you to make a new event deck. However, if this is your third time through the event deck, you don’t need to keep track because you won’t be making a new event deck.

Other players can still contribute to challenges by paying command.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3088398/when-you-go-through-the-event-deck-the-firstsecond	Is this how you play it out? My scenario: Player A starts their turn. They take a ship action, they draw the last event card and resolve it, they take their two actions (Travel, Explore, Port, Market). Player B starts their turn.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	Is the campaign the default game mode?	Campaign is the only mode. You play until you reach an ending or are defeated. On brutal mode the defeat can come fairly quickly, on normal mode I would estimate it will take 5-10 hours to reach an ending point (based on my 2 campaigns YMMV), so unless you can keep it on the table the log is very useful. Also, don’t discount the value of the map on the back.

The cardboard artifact tokens are used for end of game scoring, where they are worth 1 point each. They also have a 2 coin symbol on them, indicating they can be traded for 2 coins.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2617834/miss-damage-against-flying-enemies-with-non-ranged	Do you do any damage when you miss a flying enemy with a non-ranged weapon?	Yes. Your accuracy is reduced, but not your damage. If you have 2 fatigue tokens though, that crew will do zero damage on a miss.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609108/where-do-search-icons-come-from	"Where do ""Search"" icons come from?"	Search is a ship action. Station 2. You play a game of chicken with yourself and turn over between 1 and 3 tokens. You get to keep the reward from only 1 token, but you take ship damage (and lost morale, and maybe other stuff I'm forgetting) from every token you draw. The binoculars allow you to ignore one damage per point of YOUR perception from Search Tokens you've drawn in the above mini-game.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022849/stamina-level-card-of-odessa-what-does-it-mean	Stamina Level Card of Odessa. What does it mean?	It means the character suffers the same affects as having two fatigue tokens, but they can also have a third token. You would need to lose 2 tokens (i.e. have only one token left) to negate the negative effects of having fatigue tokens.(I.e. three tokens is just as bad as two tokens, but usually you can’t have more than two tokens, except with this ability).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2873881/i-have-some-questions-after-first-session	During combat, can you discard an equipped item with a command token?	Depends on what you mean. Some ability cards have the ability to discard themselves (when equipped). This will explicitly state so on the card itself. Also: you never put command on ability cards (that command just goes back to the supply). Weapon (not sure whether you meant this instead by 'item') cannot be discarded or re-equipped, and cannot have command on them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248889/when-my-crew-completes-4-attacks-and-the-enemy-att	When my crew completes 4 attacks and the enemy attacks, can I distribute the damage and status ailments to any crew member? Or will I get to split it among the crew members who participated in the battle this round?	It's not a counterattack, so my understanding is that it can be against any of the 9 members, regardless of whether they acted or not. But the attack is against one character, not to be divided unless they are knocked out and there is still damage left to allocate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	Travel Example 3 seems to indicate that you can move off the edge of a page as long as you're at an edge with a numbered blue arrow - fair enough. You don't have to be in the actual region that contains the arrow, just in one of the regions of that edge. Is this interpretation correct?	Yes, this is correct.  You enter on the page listed on the arrow, in any of the region(s) on the opposite edge from the direction you departed, captain's choice. (Rule Book, pg. 13)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606614/ability-clarifications-not-so-clear	"Is the ""General Crew Board Ability Rules"" section only for crew board abilities, or does it apply to Ability Cards abilities as well?"	Ability cards generally follow the same rules as general crew board abilities, assuming it is not otherwise specified.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605658/multiple-keywords-for-an-explore	Shoot! We played it where we could pick which keyword we wanted to use, since we had both (and the one seemed bad). But hindsight, that does make sense to start from top down. Ugh, well now I feel like we missed out on something or altered the game...we are a few turns after that explore action and seems it'll be a hassle to revert back. Think it'll be okay to go forward, or should we revert back?	Just move on. Mistakes will happen. It's not worth backtracking more than one turn. You will know for the future.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2853108/port-inn-action-question	"Small thing with wording, but I have a question about the Port Inn Action. Seems like it would apply to all crew members in the game, but do the benefits of the Port Inn Action (""each crew member restores 2 health and removes 1 fatigue) apply to all crew members or only the current player's crew members?"	All crew members. Including other players.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3045240/careful-aim-ability-card	"Anyone with an English copy who can check what the text on the ability card ""Careful Aim"" says?"

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596731/questions-regarding-combat	So, then the grey combat cubes are gathered again, and given out to the players again, so on and so forth until the monsters are destroyed or the players die, right?	Right	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	How is the skill number requirement handled in Sleeping Gods?	In Sleeping Gods, if it is your turn, you read the storybook. For each encounter, you'll be able to see the skill number requirement for the various choices. But you don't see the reward or the outcome until you have made your choice and succeeded/failed. The reaction paragraphs will not be on the same page as the story that you read so that you can't see the reward/consequence.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3183513/event-deck-and-discard-pile-reset	What happens to any 'ongoing' events at the end of the first age?	Ongoing effects remain until the card conditions are met, or the storybook tells you otherwise.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	Did you use defense on the characters that took part in combat?	"On 4) --> Exactly your first sentence. If a character is chosen as target for the monster's ""end of turn"" attack, he can still use its weapon defense value. (according to the rule book it would not be allowed. Weapons defense value should only be used against counterattacks)"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2778351/sea-serpent-event-does-attempting-the-challenge-ta	Are you sure?  I thought that Events happened BEFORE the Action phase and were separate?	Generally yes but this is an ongoing event that stays active until discarded and it needs an action for it to be discarded.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2669829/who-exactly-is-involved-in-combat	Who exactly is involved in combat?	I believe that everyone can be involved in combat, but depending on the amount of players, you can only have a certain amount of combat tokens. 4 tokens (1 player), 2 tokens each (2 players), 2 tokens to active player and one each for others (3 players), and 1 each (4 players). I do believe that another player can pay a command to give another combat token to another player. Each player pays command for abilities on the crew board.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2658768/hunting-serpent-action	"Has this been confirmed somewhere by the designer? It makes sense in theory, but the rules don't say anything about your 2 turn ""actions"" being open to anything other than the 4 ones on the ship board."	"Yes, any event card that has the word ""action"" on it requires you to use one of your actions to resolve it."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605775/synergy-tokens	Do synergy tokens stay on character cards after the combat in which they were placed?	"No.Pg 25 of the main rulebook, ""At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member's synergy token is on the matching crew board."" It goes on to clarify that outside of combat the tokens don't even need to be on crew boards and can be set aside."	At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member's synergy token is on the matching crew board.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	If you want to do splash damage against an enemy with resist, does that resist apply?	Yes, damage resistance applies whether the enemy is the primary target or receiving splash damage. Defense is ignored, and counter attack doesn't trigger, but other defensive abilities still modify the damage as it states whenever 'damage is dealt'. So, you'd need to do 2 splash damage to cover 1 space in this instance.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035945/can-damage-from-an-adventure-card-be-distributed-i	Can damage from an adventure card be distributed in a non-adjacent manner, or does it follow the rules for damage done by players?	All damage from the same attack must be placed adjacently (Rulepop Attack Reference), so it will have to follow the placement rules.However, adventure cards can be used 'anytime,' so it is a separate attack and doesn't have to be adjacent to other damage a character does, and can even be used before a character attacks (e.g. it can be used to disable an enemy's First Strike before anyone even attacks).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879839/accuracy-on-an-attack	"Could someone please explain how step 3 of ""attack and counterattack"" works?"	Draw fate and add that number to the weapon’s accuracy number. This total must meet or exceed the targeted enemy defense number in order to hit. Otherwise, you miss. After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	Design-wise, if a monster card had two hourglass symbols, would it go twice in the monster attack phase?	No, multiple hour glass icons per enemy card are possible. During the End of Round phase of combat all enemies attack the players. If any of these monsters have one (or more) hour glass icons, these icons will then activate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2810990/symbols-next-to-titles-in-storybook	Some have them, most don't.  What are they (if the answer isn't a spoiler of some kind)?	If it's what I'm thinking of, it indicates the author of that section. If you check the beginning of the Storybook, you should see that icon next to the writer's name.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2971238/what-means-the-plus-before-the-accuracy-number-ob	What means the + before the accuracy number on the crew weapons?	The plus # is your starting accuracy. Use that number, plus the drawn fate number, to determine whether you hit an enemy.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3250276/when-doing-a-challenge-can-i-not-use-a-crew-member	 Can anyone share the damage incurred in case of failure?	−X health: You must take crew damage. Damage must be applied to any crew members that participated first.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3260955/when-does-the-fight-start	When does the fight start?	"You can do it up until you look at the enemy card. Once you look at the enemy card, you may no longer eat food.  So when you see the word ""fight"", it doesn't matter.  Did you look at the enemy card?  If ""yes"", then combat has began and you may not eat. If ""no"" then you still may eat, even if you know that you are about to begin a fight."

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855852/when-can-you-move-equipment	When can you move equipment?	You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only the weapon info is showing.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690600/lose-food-but-no-food-unfulfilled-demand-eg-rotten	Are the two foods necessary to remove the card cumulative?	No, according to the ongoing rule, discarding 1 food on two different turns does not suffice to discard the card. You would have to pay the two foods in one single 'payment'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2791576/counter-attack-and-block	Are there any exceptions to which cards can be shared among players?	Yes, all players share ownership of adventure cards and can use them at any time, even to help another player. However, ability cards and crew board actions are exclusive to the specific crew member, except for Mac's +1 fate, which can be used to help another player.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2881308/travel-challenges	Where is it stated in the rule book that there's a hand limit?	Page 6 in the rules: Hand Limit Each player has a hand limit of 3 ability cards.

That is, if I'm correct, one doesn't need to have acquired/completed 22 totems in one game to unlock 173.	Correct. Every time you finish a game you check boxes corresponding to totems you found and the ending you got on the achievement sheet, and once you have 22 of those (accumulated over several campaigns for sure) you unlock card 173.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596627/can-you-flee-combat	Can you flee combat?	"Technically, you ""flee"" when you're defeated. Monsters in this land will chase you down, apparently, so there's no escape."

In the IRON example, the door is made of iron, not the key. It is thematically sensible to remember an iron door in the back of a cave, as it is unusual and memorable.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596731/questions-regarding-combat	At the end of the combat round, after the monsters each deal their damage and any end of round (hourglass) attacks, do the monsters stay there for the next monster encounter, or do the monsters go back to the monster pile?

While resolving damage, I discard Sharp Eye for +1 damage, but now the attack wouldn’t hit. Does damage still occur?	Yes. Once you’re in the “apply damage” phase, you can use various abilities and discard cards, but it won’t modify what combat step you’re in.

The achievement paper has a list of totems and endings for you to track your progress through multiple campaigns and a list of unlockable cards on the bottom left of the sheet for cards you can use when you begin a new campaign once earned. But yes, most of the sheet is a list of totems.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2256898/game-mechanics	Is it possible to do challenges / search over and over again? What's stopping you from doing the same action over and over again?	There's a timer built into the game, with the sleeping god attacking your ship after a period of turns. If you waste your time searching the same location over and over, you are giving yourself way less time to find the relics and win the game, and risking having your ship sunk.

So I would guess if you come across twice in the same playthrough, just ignore the second instance.

The level cards are permanent and can be used repeatedly if the situation they apply to comes up and any associated cost is paid. They don't get blocked by command tokens like character board abilities do. As long as you keep sacrificing his health, Rafael can keep running in a circle, repeatedly intercepting face-punches as long as he is able.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2641023/defaeted-enemies-are-they-removed-can-they-regen	Defeated enemies, are they removed, can they regen?	Yes, you remove the defeated enemy and slide the other two together. So enemy 3 would heal enemy 1, which would have become adjacent. And yes, when you kill an enemy it won't counter-attack!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606098/search-token-definition	The search token with a coin and a low morale. Do you gain or lose the morale. I assume gain, but then why would you ever select that one?	You get the low morale status even if you don’t select that token. Ryan clarified that it’s the same as damage, you take it immediately when revealed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690600/lose-food-but-no-food-unfulfilled-demand-eg-rotten	What are the types of ongoing events?	"There are essentially two types of ongoing events where you can either spend an action to do a challenge to get rid of them or do a challenge at the end of a turn. Rotten Supplies and Rats cards, while ongoing thematically, don't have the ""ongoing"" keyword, meaning the usual rules for ongoing events don't apply to them."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606321/adventure-card-38-spoilers	With the Gate Stone (Adventure Card 38), it says “Move to Any Port”.  Does this include any port in the game including ports that I have not visited yet?	We were pretty sure it meant you could go to any port on the map, but decided to play it that we could go only to ports we've been to (either in this or past campaigns). No real reason for the restriction except we actually wanted to slow ourselves down, oddly enough. With so much to explore we didn't want to just zip around skipping all the fun stuff in between. But now that we achieved our first ending, I can see how down the line you'd want to teleport all over the place when looking to collect/accomplish particular things.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2851199/spoiler-starting-the-second-campaign	At the end of our ordeal, we were instructed to place Laurent back in game box. Will we get him back again at the start of the second run?	Correct. You will get all characters (including Laurent) back at the beginning of each campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2610743/first-strike	"What does ""first strike,"" mean on an enemy and where is this in the rulebook?"	"Rule Book pg. 35, ""First Strike""This ability is active until disabled. Any time a crew member attacks this enemy, the enemy counterattacks first."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2727593/clarification-on-spolier-at-location-40	And to be honest, I'm not sure what all the errata are.  Is there a link for the complete errata?

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3129703/exhausted-event-decks-after-era-1-what-happens-aft	Is it normal in video games to find something that needs a specific item or keyword to progress?	Yes, it is a normal part of the design in many video games. Players often need to find a specific item or keyword to progress, which is a common gameplay mechanic.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	Means, 2 of my available skills were not active? Which of them is chosen by me? Or are they depending on my current necessary skills like savvy in my actual challenge?	it means all skills count as 2 points lower when making a skill check.so if you had 3 savvy, it would only add +1, not +3 in a savvy check.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	What if you can't place the last attack damage?	I would definitely cover one of them and the rest is wasted damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596679/do-i-have-to-do-map-challenges-when-passing-throug	Do I have to do map challenges when passing through?	"I believe they're the 'entry cost' to get into that space.  They have to be done regardless of stopping or not. The rulebook says ""If you move into a region with a hazard, you must complete the hazard's challenge or take the negative consequence."" (p.13)"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683876/challenges-step-3-can-you-use-abilities-on-chars-n	Is it legal to use Mac's World Lore ability without choosing anyone to participate in the challenge?	Yes, it is considered legal to use Mac's World Lore ability during any challenge, as long as Mac can still take damage. This does not require Mac or any other character to participate in the challenge, allowing for strategic flexibility.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3043563/strange-illness-event-does-it-apply-if-the-1-is-re	Strange Illness event - Does it apply if the 1 is rerolled?	"For things like this, I take that to mean when you draw/get affected by a fate of ""1"" you get the event. Re-rolling/re-drawing from the use of powers - you are literally ""changing your fate."" Whether it applies to a challenge, a combat roll, or something else your new result replaces the original draw like it never happened - so Strange Illness wouldn't activate. If you run out of re-draws and end on another 1, then you'd get the Strange Illness effect once (you wouldn't get it multiple times for all the 1's you rolled as part of the check)."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601453/resolution-of-event-cards	Just learning the game and going through the walkthrough. I drew the event card ‘Maintenance’ which would allow to repair 1 ship damage. In such a case as not having damage is it okay to bypass resolving the event? This makes me wonder if other cards would have similar situations where they would make no difference if you were to attempt it. Can you ignore cards in such circumstances?	If an event card has only one challenge listed, you cannot skip it. You'd just not get a reward in this case.(updated rulebook, version 3.1)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2790265/end-of-event-deck-procedure	It also doesn't say anything about status effects, so do not remove status effects, correct?	Correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606938/fishing-ability-card	"How does this card work? It is an ability card that says, ""When you use the Deck, draw fate, if 4+, gain 1 meat."" Does this mean if I use gloria for 2 ability cards, I use this for each draw? Do I draw 2 everytime I use the deck whether it be for a draw, challenge, or combat?"	The Deck is a ship action space, used to draw search tokens. When you use that ship action, you draw a fate card, and gain 1 meat when you get a 4+.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640098/cooking-questions	What does ‘while exploring’ mean in Outdoor Cooking Set?	I'd say just when using the Explore action and before 'Return to Ship'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3012276/do-discarded-ability-cards-go-to-the-bottom-of-the	Do discarded ability cards go to the bottom of the gate deck?	"Rulebook, p. 10 under Ship Action: ""If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck.""...so, you create a discard pile and reshuffle it as needed."	If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	In Above and Below, did you know the numbers needed to succeed?	In Above and Below you absolutely did know the number(s) you needed to succeed, so it wasn't like you were blindly picking.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022849/stamina-level-card-of-odessa-what-does-it-mean	There is a level card (I believe for Marco) that allows you to substitute one ingredient when cooking a recipe. So once you have that, you can use a meat in a non-meat recipe.	True. We are on a ship though, travelling through an archipelago. So veggies/grain being more rare than fish might be kinda sequitur (TBone pic and all.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2960501/travel	Will the Sea Serpent token follow us even if we move to a new page? Across multiple pages? What if we use an effect to arrive at a new space but not by “travel”?	It will follow you wherever you go. Page 12:  “ Hunting Serpent Special Rule: For this event, if you turn to a new page of the atlas, place the serpent on the region your ship starts in.”	“ Hunting Serpent Special Rule: For this event, if you turn to a new page of the atlas, place the serpent on the region your ship starts in.”

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601437/a-smattering-of-post-play-questions-search-tokens	In the case of needing coins for a trade, how many coins do you need to choose the option?	You only need 1 coin to use that option, you don't need extra to cover possible failure consequences.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597263/event-card-question	If you can't lose the X, can you still pick that option and just gain the 1 fatigue. Or if you can't pay the cost, you can't pick that option?	No, if you can't pay the cost, you cannot choose that option.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605333/enemy-end-of-round-damage	Which of these statements is correct:A) Since all the damage must go to one crew member, I could choose Audrie, apply 1 damage token and ignore the rest. (I know this isn't correct but it is a logical possibility from the wording above).B) I assign one damage to Audrie and give 6 damage to Rafael.C) I am forced to choose Rafael because only he has the capacity to absorb 7 damage tokens (since all damage must be assigned to a single crew member).I think that (B) is the correct answer but I want to make sure my interpretation is correct.	B) is correctThis is stated clearly on page 24 of the most recent rules, found on RRG website.  It’s the last bullet in the same section of that same page.“If a crew member runs out of health while taking damage, any remaining damage must be dealt to another crew member, and so on.”(...it chains if a lot of damage is dealt).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2966219/reading-events	When reading events, if it calls for a test or something does it work same way as a challenge? Like someone is picked and fatigued and other people can add more if they wish, etc?	Yeah absolutely, you can as always choose whether or not you want crew members to participate, following standard challenge rules.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3253107/zombie-merchant-event	So assuming I have $5, I can purchase all 15 food tokens? This seems absurdly powerful, no matter the 50% chance of gaining weakened. Am I misreading this card?	"Your interpretation sounds right to me, especially given the opening qualifier ""you may purchase any number...."" I also agree that it does seem absurdly overpowered. Hoping I do come across it now!"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648879/question-about-story-1-spoiler-for-going-through-f	When it says restore health, that does include status tokens?	No it does not. When you restore all health, you do not remove fatigue or status tokens unless specifically instructed to do so.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3081668/can-i-still-use-a-weapon-if-it-makes-me-gain-a-sta	Can I still use a weapon if it makes me gain a status effect I already have?	"I think you should be able to continue to use it. In challenges and combat monster attacks, status effects must be distributed to another character that doesn't have that status effect yet, but the rules are different when an effect names a specific character.  In those cases, if the specified character already has the status to be applied, the effect to apply the status is simply ignored, with the rest of the result taking effect normally.  This is the one scenario where you would not instead choose a different character to receive that effect.  In this case, I see the weapon's effect to be the same thing. While it isn't identifying a specific character by name, it is stating ""this crew member"", meaning the character that used the weapon to attack.  So I would say that the crew member must take the low morale if they don't already have it, but if they do, you simply ignore the application of that effect and may use the rest of the card normally. It would not prevent you from using the weapon. You just are always sad while using it :-)."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	When it comes to note-taking how much do you write down?	You can use the journal log to record xp, to note how many times you have gone through the event deck, and you can use the map on the other side to note where you have been and wish to go. I also recommend listing the totems you find by number as you acquire them. It's helpful during the Game, as you will learn, to know how many you have.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	If they have a vest with a block ability that takes 1 command to activate, how long does it stay active after I assign a command token to it?	All abilities, whether they are from character boards, adventure cards or the small cards are one time use. So, if you block one damage using an ability, you block a single damage for the cost of 1 command, that's it. No less, no more.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3000221/clarifying-some-rules	Do all ability cards always have to be equipped before you can use the effect?	Yes. Until an ability card is equipped, a crew member cannot use its ability or gain the bonus to the skill on the card. While in hand, you can either spend command to equip it, or discard it to aid in a challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2602921/is-command-limited	Is command limited?	"Yes, command is limited. Edit: Page 8, ""Limited Components"" has the answer. Everything is limited, except damage tokens."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594099/visiting-a-port-action-clarification	I guess since you choose which weapon to use when you have more than one, you can always pick the one with lower accuracy bonus?	Yes, that's true!

The synergy token does not need to be used ('may'), but only lasts until the end of that combat. When you start combat against a new monster, step 3 of combat setup is to replace synergy on their owner's board.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Not seeing a clarification on when to remove. Is it instantly, after that event is played, or end of turn?	First Time: After you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player’s turn. On the next turn, read paragraph 1 in the storybook instead of drawing an event card. Paragraph 1 will eventually tell you to remove the ability cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2971238/what-means-the-plus-before-the-accuracy-number-ob	Can I add starting weapon accuracy and accuracy of added weapons or added ability cards together?	No.  You use either your starting weapon or an equipped weapon.  Not both.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2841162/possible-to-re-gain-a-completed-quest	This is also covered in the rules for Quest Cards:	When the storybook says “Lose quest x,” or “Complete quest x,” place the specified card in the used quest box.

It is only that crew member	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2735968/official-solo-rules	What is the main cost of repeated spaces like this?	The main cost of repeated spaces like this is just an opportunity cost. If you're taking extra turns to re-do that one spot for the rewards, then you're not spending turns exploring new locations which potentially might have higher numbers of rewards. But unless there's a keyword blocking you, you are allowed to repeat locations.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623697/are-status-tokens-limited	Are status tokens limited?	Yes. All tokens are limited except damage tokens. There are only 4 of each status token except low morale, so if you have 4 of your crew weakened, for example, then nobody else can become weakened until someone is cured. Updated rule book page 8.
