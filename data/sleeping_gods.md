## Overview (page 1)

1-4 players, ages 13+, 1-20 hours

"This is the Wandering Sea. The gods have brought you here, and you must wake them if you wish to return home."

In Sleeping Gods, you and up to three friends become Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, lost in a strange world in 1929 on your steamship, the Manticore. You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home.

Sleeping Gods is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play alone or with friends throughout your campaign— it's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find as many totems as possible, which are hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.

Sleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.

Sleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters. Your choices affect the characters and the plot of the game, and may help or hinder your chances of getting home!

Welcome to a vast world. Your journey starts now.

## Setup (page 4)

Follow these instructions if you are starting a new campaign. If this is your first campaign, we recommend using the quick start guide first. If you are setting up the game to continue a campaign, turn to pg. 32.

1. Place the atlas in the center of the table and turn to pg. 2. Place the ship in the sea region that contains the number 2 location.

2. Place the ship board near the atlas. Place the correct side face up depending on number of players, 1-2 or 3-4, listed in the top right corner of the ship board. Place the ship action token on the ship board. Place 3 coins and 1 grain on the ship board. You start the game with these resources.

3. Place the Captain Sofi Odessa crew board near the ship board, in the center of the table. Distribute the remaining 8 crew boards among the players as evenly as possible. Each player places their crew boards in front of them. Place the synergy tokens nearby.

4. Shuffle the ability deck and place it near the ship board. Decide who will be the first player and give them the captain token.

5. Shuffle the market deck and place it nearby.

6. Separate the event cards by type (mild, perilous, deadly). Shuffle each pile separately. Draw 6 deadly cards and place them face down in a new deck. Draw 6 perilous cards and place them face down on top of the deadly. Draw 6 mild cards and place them face down on top of the perilous. You should now have a deck of 18 event cards. Place this deck face down on its slot on the ship board. Place the unused cards in the box.

7. Place the starting adventure cards near the ship board. These cards are: Gloria, Soup, Gear, and Flapjacks (you can find these cards in the market deck). Place the magnetic card box that contains adventure and quest cards nearby IMPORTANT: Do not change the order of cards in the quest card and adventure card decks, and do not look through the cards unless instructed.

8. Place the deck of enemy cards near the board, face down. IMPORTANT: Do not change the order of cards in this deck and do not look through this deck unless instructed.

9. Place the storybook near the board.

10. Shuffle the search tokens and place them in a stack, face down, near the ship board.

11. Give each player (not each crew member) 1 command and 1 ability card.

12. Place the level cards near the ship board. You may look through these at any time. Place all remaining tokens near the board.

13. Retrieve a new journey log sheet for your campaign. Decide if you will be playing normal or brutal mode and check the appropriate box (see "Defeat" on pg. 28). Write the date at the top of the sheet and write in all players' names at the bottom of the sheet.

## Basics (page 6)

Pgs. 6-9 introduce some basics of Sleeping Gods to help you get your sea legs. Turn structure and actions are explained starting on pg. 10.

### Ship Board (page 6)

#### Ship Room (page 6)

There are five rooms on the ship. Each room contains an action that you can take at the start of your turn. Each room also contains spaces for ship damage. A room with all damage spaces filled may not be used for a ship action. Once the ship has 11 damage, you are defeated!

After taking a ship action and drawing an event card, perform two of these actions.

> The actions that you can perform appear in the lower-right corner of the ship board.

Each turn draw and resolve an event card from the event deck, placed here.

> The event deck is placed in the lower-left corner of the ship board.

### Crew Board (page 7)

Each player controls 2 or more crew. Crew take damage and fatigue throughout the game.

Each crew member has a unique set of skills.

> Crew member skills appear along the upper-right side of the crew board.

You may pay command to use unique crew member abilities.

> Crew member abilities appear near the bottom-middle of the crew board.

Name And Origin

> Name and origin appear in the lower-left of the crew board.

When you equip ability cards to a crew member, place them beneath these 2 slots.

> The two slots are at the bottom left of the crew board.

Health: A crew member may only take damage up to their maximum health.

> A crew member's maximum health appears in a heart near the bottom-middle of the crew board.

Weapon Stats: Accuracy, Damage, Block.

> Weapon stats: accuracy, damage, and block appear in the lower-right of the crew board.

### Ability Card (page 7)

This card has a fate number of 5. When you "draw fate," you draw an ability card and use this number.

> The Fate Number appears at the top-left of the card.

To equip this card to a crew member, you must pay 2 command.

> The commands for equipping the card to a crew member are on the top-right.

This card has a savvy skill symbol. When equipped, it gives a crew member +1 savvy.

> The symbol for the savvy skill appears on the left-hand side, halfway up the card.

When this card is equipped, it gives the crew member the "Triage" ability. It costs no command to use once equipped.

> The visual representation of the "Triage" ability is in the middle at the bottom of the card.

Secret: Players must keep their abilities cards in hand secret until they are played. They may not show them or give them to other players.

Hand Limit: Each player has a hand limit of 3 ability cards. If after drawing new Ability Cards your hand size has exceeded the limit, you must immediately discard down to 3 cards. You may select the card(s) to discard.

### Game Concepts And Terms (page 8)

#### Active Player (page 8)

When it is your turn, you are the active player.

#### Damage (page 8)

Damage is physical and mental injury to a crew member or an enemy, represented by damage tokens (the blood drop). If the storybook or a card says "-1 health," it means take 1 damage. When a crew member takes damage, place the indicated amount of damage tokens on the crew board.

When you are instructed to "Restore health" to a crew member, remove the specified number of damage tokens.

This symbol represents the amount of damage dealt by a crew member or enemy card in an attack.

#### Health (page 8)

Health is the amount of damage a crew member can take and still function normally. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health. Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt.

If all crew members have 0 health, you are defeated (see "Defeat" on pg. 28).

A crew member's damage cannot exceed their health—any excess must be placed on another crew member.

#### Command (page 8)

Command represents your crew's readiness and ability to work together. You must pay command to activate crew abilities and adventure cards, to equip ability cards to crew members, and to help other players on their turn by using your crew members.

#### Draw Fate (page 8)

Draw a card from the ability card deck and check the number in the top left corner. Immediately discard this card. You draw fate for skill challenges, attacks, and more. Designer's Note: In this deck, 1s and 6s are half as common as the other numbers.

#### Challenge (page 8)

You may be faced with challenges you must overcome, usually when reading from the storybook but also when you draw event cards. It involves selecting crew members to participate and drawing fate in an effort to reach or exceed a specified challenge number (see pg. 19).

#### Fatigue (page 8)

When crew members participate in challenges, they gain fatigue, represented by a fatigue token. Each crew member can hold up to 2 fatigue tokens.

Each fatigue token is double-sided. If a crew member has only 1 token, place the blank side face up. If a crew member has a 2nd fatigue token, it should have the "-1 damage" side face up. This causes the crew member to deal -1 damage in combat.

A crew member with 2 fatigue tokens cannot participate in challenges (pg. 19), but can continue to participate in combat (pg. 21).

You can remove fatigue mainly by cooking recipes or performing a port action.

#### Limited Components (page 8)

All components are limited, which means that if you run out, you cannot gain or use more, with one exception: damage tokens. If you run out of damage tokens, use something else to keep track.

#### Region (page 9)

A region of the sea on the atlas. Regions are separated by dotted lines, land, the spiral binding of the atlas, and the edge of the page. The ship cannot reside on or move through land, only sea regions.

#### Ship Damage (page 9)

When instructed to take ship damage, draw 1 ability card per damage, then place a cube on the room(s) with a matching fate number. Each ship room can only take 2 damage and the hull can take 1 damage. If a room already has 2 damage, you may choose where to place the damage. If a room has 2 damage, it cannot be used during the ship action phase. If the ship ever has 11 damage cubes, you are defeated (see "Defeat" on pg. 28).

Repair refers to removing ship damage. If you "repair 2," you remove any 2 damage from the ship.

#### Skills (page 9)

There are 5 types of crew skills in the game. Most crew members start with 2 to 4 skills.

Strength: Used when anything requires physical effort or endurance.

Perception: Used to search, use hand-eye coordination, detect, or use senses. Also used to hide and sneak.

Savvy: Used when anything requires knowledge, either from study or experience.

Craft: Used when something must be built, repaired, taken apart, maintained, or refined. Also used to run the ship's engines and to travel.

Cunning: Used when you must convince, lead, speak, deceive, devise, or plot.

#### Supply (page 9)

When the game refers to "the supply," it means the components that you currently do not own. For example, if you are instructed to "return a meat token to the supply," you take the token from your ship board and return it to the pile of components off to the side of the board. When you are told to "pay," "discard," or "remove" something, it means to return it to the supply.

#### Status (page 9)

There are five types of status tokens in the game. When a crew member gains a status, place the appropriate token on their crew board. Each crew member can have multiple status tokens, but may not have more than one copy of each status. Crew members gain status tokens in stories and combat. Crew members can remove status tokens through character and adventure card abilities.

- Venom: The crew member takes 1 damage at the start of each player's turn.

- Frightened: The crew member cannot be used for attack actions.

- Weakened: -2 to each of the crew member's skills.

- Madness: The crew member takes 1 damage when they participate in skill challenges.

- Low Morale: You must pay 1 extra command to use the crew member in skill challenges.

#### Journey Log (page 9)

When you start a new campaign, write your name and date on a new journey log sheet. You use this sheet to track certain information when you save your game during the campaign (and also as a memento of your journey). You can also keep notes on the world map to help you remember important information. You can use world map notes from previous campaigns when you play a new campaign.

#### World Map and The Tides of Ruin Expansion (page 9)

In Sleeping Gods, the atlas includes 9 maps to explore, but if you examine the map on your journey log, you can see that this is only part of the game world. These extra maps and locations are included in the Tides of Ruin expansion.

## Turn Overview (page 10)

This is a summary of the steps you take on your turn. The steps are explained in detail on pgs. 10-16.

Starting with the first player, players take turns in clockwise order. Follow these steps on your turn:

1. Ship Action: Choose a ship action. Move the ship action figure to one of the five ship rooms and apply the effect. You must move the ship action figure to a new room each turn (you cannot repeat the same room two turns in a row). (See pg. 10-11.)

2. Event: Draw an event card and read the effect. Events may present a choice, a challenge, consequence, or other effect. (For challenges, see pg. 19.) Resolve the event card before continuing your turn. (For event card rules, see pg. 12.)

3. Two Actions: Perform two actions. Available actions are listed on the bottom of the ship board. You may perform the same action twice in one turn. These actions are explained starting on pg. 13.

4. End of Turn: After you have performed your two actions, pass the captain token to the player on the left. That player now starts their turn.

## Player Turn (page 10)

### 1. Ship Action (page 10)

Move the ship action figure to one of the five ship rooms and apply the effect.

- The five ship rooms include: Bridge, Galley, Deck, Quarters, & Sick Bay. (The Hull has no action.)

- Ship action effects can be applied in any order.

- You may never give command tokens/ ability cards to other players. If the supply of command tokens runs out, you cannot gain any until more tokens are returned to the supply. If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck.

- If you cannot take an action because all rooms have 2 damage, move the ship action figure to one of the rooms, but take no ship action.

Ship room effects vary depending on the number of players in the game. When a room shows two numbers over the command token symbol, check the player count symbol at the top right corner of the ship board. This tells you what amount of command to take (depending on the number of players).

When playing with 3-4 players, use the side of the ship board that has this symbol.

> The symbol looks like a person alongside the notation "3/4."

On this side of the ship board, the Quarters room gives 4/5 command tokens. If playing with 3 players, you gain 4 command when you use this room, and 5 command if playing with 4 players. Also, you return 3 command on cards to the supply.

> The quarter token is a blue hexagon with the notation "4/5" inscribed.

Bridge: Draw 1 ability card and gain the specified number of command tokens. Also remove any command tokens placed on all crew members (even those controlled by other players) and adventure cards and return them to the supply.

Galley: Draw 2 ability cards (1 ability card if playing with 1 or 2 players) and gain the specified number of command tokens. Also, you may discard exactly 1 ability card from your hand to remove 1 fatigue from any crew member.

Deck: Gain the specified number of command tokens. Also, you may draw up to 3 search tokens. Draw each token one at a time before deciding to continue drawing or stop. Apply any damage shown on all tokens, but keep the rewards from only one token. After applying the effects, place the search tokens in a discard pile. If you run out, shuffle the search tokens and make a new draw pile.

Quarters: Draw 1 ability card and gain the specified number of command tokens. Also, remove any 3 command tokens (2 if playing with 1 or 2 players) placed on crew members (even crew members controlled by other players) and adventure cards and return them to the supply.

Sick Bay: Draw 1 ability card and gain the specified number of command tokens. Also, restore 1 health to any crew member.

### 2. Event (page 12)

Draw the top card of the event deck and read it aloud. Apply the effect or complete the challenge.

- Some event cards have multiple choices. In this case, choose one and apply the effect.

- If you draw an event card with the word "ongoing," place it face up near the ship board. Apply the effects until you're able to discard the card. (The way to discard the card is described on each card.)

- You cannot ignore an event card. If it only has 1 challenge listed, you must complete it.

Over the course of each campaign, you will go through the event deck 3 times. Each time you reach the end of the event deck, follow these instructions:

#### First Time (page 12)

After you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player's turn. On the next turn, read paragraph 1 in the storybook instead of drawing an event card.

#### Second Time (page 12)

After you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player's turn. On the next turn, read paragraph 1.2 instead of drawing an event card.

#### Third Time (page 12)

After you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player's turn. On the next turn, read paragraph F1 instead of drawing an event card.

### 3. Two Actions (page 13)

Perform 2 of the following actions: travel, explore, market, or port.

- You may choose the same action twice.

- You may choose to skip an action to gain 1 command. You may do this for one or both actions.

#### Action: Travel (page 13)

This action allows you to move the ship to a new region. Regions are separated by dotted lines, land, the spiral binding of the atlas, and the edge of the page. Whenever you travel, you perform a CRAFT challenge:

First decide if you want one of your crew members (with a craft skill) to participate. If so, place 1 fatigue token on their crew board. (You may travel without using a crew member.)

Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total. Check the result on the travel table on the ship board (see right) for the distance you may travel. For each distance you may move to 1 adjacent region. For example, a result of 8 would allow you to travel up to 3 distance.

Hazards: If you move into a region with a hazard, you must successfully complete the hazard's challenge or take negative consequences. The challenge type and difficulty are on the left of the icon, and the consequence for failure is on the right. If it is a damage icon, take ship damage. If you are successful in the challenge, do not take the consequences.

Edge of the Map: If you reach the edge of the map and want to keep going in the same direction, you may do so as long as there is an icon indicating which page to turn to (although some pages are unavailable unless you have the Tides of Ruin expansion). Follow these steps:

- First, remove the ship token from the map.

- Turn to the page in the atlas as specified on the edge you are crossing and place your ship token on that page.

- You always enter the map on the opposite side of where you left. For example, if you cross the northern edge of the atlas, you enter on the southern edge on the new page, etc. If there are multiple regions on the new edge, you choose which to start on. See the diagrams on the next page.

Designer's Note on Travel: The Manticore has enough coal in its stores to last you the entire trip, so you do not need to worry about fuel.

Travel Example 1 Zoey moves the ship to a region with a hazard of ghostly fog. She must attempt a challenge of CUNNING 5. She places a fatigue token on Captain Odessa to add her cunning. She draws a fate of 1. Captain Odessa has 1 cunning, so 1+1=2, a failure (she needed 5 or more). Zoey takes 1 low morale token and places it on Captain Odessa.

> In travel example 1, you'll find the ship located in the upper right corner with a red arrow indicating the direction to the left, leading toward the ghostly fog.

Travel Example 2 Zoey moves the ship to a region with a hazard of rocky shores. She attempts a SAVVY 5 challenge. She chooses Gregory and Kannan to participate, giving her 2 savvy. She draws 2, so the total is 2+2=4, so she must take 1 ship damage. If she had obtained at least 5, she would have ignored the ship damage.

> In travel example 2, the ship is positioned in the lower right corner, while a prominent red arrow directs attention towards the perilous rocky shores.

Travel Example 3 Zoey wants to travel to a new map. She decides to move across the western edge of the current map. This leads to pg. 13 (as indicated by the blue arrow), so she turns to pg. 13. She must enter on the opposite side of this new map, so she starts on a region bordering the eastern edge. She can choose to start on either region, and she chooses the northern region.

> In Travel Example 3, the ship is located on page 3, with a directional arrow pointing towards the northern edge of page 13.

#### Action: Explore (page 15)

Explore one of the locations with a red circle outline on the region where the ship is located. When you explore, you make choices, complete challenges, and/or participate in combat.

First, choose a location to explore and open the storybook to the paragraph number listed on the location on the map.

Read the first box of text in the story (read aloud unless you are playing solo). At the end of each story paragraph, one of the following will occur:

- Make a choice. This may include a challenge or combat (detailed on pgs. 19 and 21, respectively). After completing the challenge or combat (if any), turn to the listed story number.

- Gain rewards or suffer negative effects. These are listed in italics.

- The end of each explore action is indicated by the phrase, "Return to the ship." The active player continues their turn as normal (or ends it, if they have taken two actions).

NOTE: Do not read ahead or turn to any further paragraphs until you have made your choice/ completed your challenge. You are not meant to know what comes in a future paragraph before you make your choice.

#### Story Example (page 15)

A

You wake in the cold dirt. Dew drips from your clothes and your hands ache, bound with crude rope.

You take in your surroundings: a wooden hut with an open doorway. Most of the crew lies next to you.

A. Cut the rope bindings on some nearby rocks. CUNNING 5 Fail: -3 health (Turn to A1)

B. Wriggle free of the rope bindings. STRENGTH 6 Fail: -3 health (Turn to A1)

#### Action: Visit a Market Location (page 15)

The ship must be in the same region as a market location.

Draw 7 cards from the market deck (market cards are adventure cards that you can purchase). You may purchase any number of them according to their cost listed in coins on the card near the card name. Place any that you purchase near the ship board, next to your other adventure cards, face up. Place any cards that you do not purchase from the market at the bottom of the market deck.

Exception: If you purchase a weapon, equip it to one of your crew. Each crew member may equip any number of weapons.

Market Cards

Market Location

#### Action: Visit a Port (page 16)

The ship must be in the same region as a port. You may then perform any or all of the following actions once. (Port actions are listed on the port board.)

Inn: Pay 4 coins. Each crew member restores 2 health and removes 1 fatigue.

Shipyard: Pay any number of materials resource tokens or coins to the supply to repair 1 ship damage per materials token/coin you pay (in any combination).

Healer: Pay 1 coin to restore all health to a crew member. You can do this for any number of crew members at a cost of 1 coin per crew member.

Spend XP: You may spend XP to purchase level cards for any crew members. See below.

When you take a "visit a port" action, you may pay XP (experience points) to buy level cards for your crew members. Each crew member has specific level cards. You may look through these cards at any time.

Keep track of XP you gain on your journey log sheet. Cross off or mark when you spend these points buying level cards.

When you buy a level card, immediately equip it to the associated crew member. You can equip an ability by tucking the card beneath the crew board so that the character image on the card is hidden. This card remains equipped for the remainder of the campaign. (Do not shuffle it into the ability deck at any time.) Level cards do not count toward the 2-card limit for equipped ability cards (see pg. 17). Once equipped, you may not discard them to use other abilities or to add to an attack.

### 4. End of Turn (page 16)

Pass the captain token to the player on the left. It is now that player's turn.

## Spending Command (page 17)

Command represents the crew's mental and physical readiness and their ability to work together.

You may spend command at any time, even on other players' turns (with some exceptions, as explained below). You may spend command to do the following:

### Equip an Ability Card (page 17)

Play an ability card from your hand to one of your crew members. This is known as "equipping an ability." This represents time that the crew member spends training and readying for adventure. Pay the command cost listed at the top right of the ability card to the supply. Then tuck the ability card beneath the bottom edge of the crew board so that the skill icon and any ability is showing.

- Equip ability cards to any crew member, including the captain and other players' crew members.

- Each crew member can have a total of 2 equipped ability cards at once (not including any level cards or weapons the crew member has). The player who controls the crew member may discard equipped ability cards at any time.

- Each equipped card increases the crew member's skill number by 1 in the type shown on the card.

- Some equipped cards also give the crew member (or player that controls that crew member) an ability. Most of these abilities do not require you to spend command to use them once they are equipped.

- You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge.

Command Tokens

> Command tokens look like blue hexagons.

Pay 2 command to equip this ability card from your hand to Laurent.

> Command tokens are at the top right of the ability cards. The example card requires two command tokens to equip the character Laurent.

### Activate Crew Ability (page 18)

You may pay command to activate one of your crew member's abilities. Place the required command on their crew board to indicate that they have used an ability, then gain the effects. You may not use another ability on this crew member until all command tokens have been removed from their crew board. (See pg. 34 for ability clarifications.)

Activate Adventure Cards You may pay command to activate an adventure card ability. Place the required command on the adventure card to indicate you have used its ability, then gain the effects. You may not use this ability again until all command tokens have been removed from this adventure card. All players share ownership of adventure cards. ANY player can use adventure cards you own at any time, even to help another player in a challenge or combat.

- While in combat, you cannot cook recipes or activate adventure cards that allow you to move the ship.

- While performing the explore action, you cannot activate adventure cards that allow you to move the ship. You can, however, cook recipes in the middle of an explore action.

Place 2 command on Laurent to gain 1 meat or to add 1 to his accuracy.

> The command tokens needed to obtain 1 meat or enhance accuracy by 1 are positioned at the bottom center of the crew member card.

Place 1 command on this card to gain 2 strength, 3 perception, or 1 block.

> The required commands are located at the bottom right corner of the adventure cards.

### Activate Ability Card Abilities (page 18)

Some ability cards require you to spend command to activate their ability after they have been equipped to a crew member. You do not need to place this command on the ability card (just return it to the supply). You may not spend command that has been placed on a crew board or adventure card.

### Other Command Uses (page 18)

You may also spend command to:

- Give another player your unused combat action token during combat (pg. 21).

- Have your crew members participate in a challenge on another player's turn (pg. 19).

Important: Any time you must "pay" or "spend" command, return it to the supply unless you are using it to activate an ability on an adventure card or crew board. When activating an ability on an adventure card or crew board, place the command on the card/crew board.

## Challenges (page 19)

A challenge is a test of skill that you must overcome. Each challenge is associated with one of the five crew skills: strength, cunning, savvy, perception, or craft.

A basic challenge looks like this:

Strength 5 Fail: -3 Health

In this example, you must achieve a total of 5 strength or higher. If you fail you will take the failure consequence.

To overcome a challenge, follow these steps:

1. Decide which of your crew members participate (from crew members that you control and Captain Sofi Odessa). Crew members with 2 fatigue cannot participate. You cannot use a crew member more than once per challenge. Place 1 fatigue token on each crew member that participates.

If another player wants to use the crew members they control to participate in the challenge, they must pay 1 command. This cost is the same no matter how many crew members they use. They must also give each of their participating crew members 1 fatigue.

Example: Tom is the active player and chooses Captain Sofi Odessa to participate. Zoey decides to participate with two of her crew members, and she pays 1 command to do so.

Determine the sum of the specified skills on participating crew members (which is usually 1 per crew member plus any relevant equipped ability cards they have) and move to the next step.

2. Draw Fate: Draw a card from the ability deck and check the fate number in the top left corner of the card. Add the participating crew skill to this number. The resulting number is your total skill.

3. You may now use crew abilities, adventure cards, and equipped ability cards to alter the outcomes of the fate draw by spending command to activate their abilities. Any player may also discard ability cards in hand to give +1 skill of the type specified on the card. Players may discard any number of ability cards.

4. If the final skill number is equal to or greater than the required challenge number, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail and must take consequences.

5. Discard the ability card used for "drawing fate."

### Pass the Challenge (page 19)

If you obtain a high enough skill number, ignore any listed failure consequences. Read the next line and follow the instructions.

### Failure (page 20)

If you fail, apply the consequences listed after the word "fail." These are some of the possible consequences:

- X health: You must take crew damage. Damage must be applied to any crew members that participated first. The active player decides where to place damage. Example: Cid, Jamey, and Zoey achieve 8 skill, but they needed 9 to pass the challenge. The fail consequence is -9 health. They each participated with one of their crew members and decide to split the damage between them. Each crew member takes 3 damage.

- Ship Damage: You must take the listed ship damage. Remember to draw fate for each damage cube so that you know in which room to place it.

- Turn to X: Some fail consequences require you to turn to a different story number than if you had succeeded. You must turn to the specified "fail" story number (in italics), instead of the number listed on the next line (if any).

- Gain Venom/Weakened/Frightened/Madness/Low Morale: Place the appropriate token on one of your crew members. Place it on participating crew members first, if they don't already have the same status. (Remember that a crew member cannot have 2 of the same status token.)

- If a consequence lists a specific crew member, apply the effects to that crew board.

Sometimes there will be a "Failure Description" listed to describe what happened in the story. Read this only if you fail.

After applying the consequences for failing, if you were not instructed to turn to a different story number, apply any effects on the next line and continue reading as if you had succeeded.

Designer's Note: Failure doesn't always mean that you aren't able to complete your task. Occasionally it does, but often it just means that you suffer injury or negative consequences in your effort to complete the task.

#### Failure Example (page 20)

In the choice below, Tom achieves 7 skill, so he must apply the listed failure effects. He takes 7 damage. He also must place a venom token on one of his crew members. He reads the failure description and then turns to 54.6, continuing as normal.

A. Search for their trail and follow it into the desert. PERCEPTION 10 Fail: -7 health & gain 1 venom. (The crew runs into and steps on a pack of sand-colored cobras.) (Turn to 54.6)

#### Challenge Example (page 20)

Cid must complete this challenge:

A. Climb the vine-covered cliff. STRENGTH 7 Fail: -8 health (Turn to 16.9)

First Cid chooses to have Laurent and Captain Odessa participate. He places a fatigue token on each of their player boards. They each have 1 strength skill, for a total of 2. Cid draws fate 4. 2+4=6, not enough to succeed.

He may activate one of his adventure cards that lets him redraw fate. He places 1 command on the "Gear" card which allows him to redraw. He draws fate 5. 2+5=7, enough for a success.

Cid succeeds, so he can ignore the consequences of -8 health. He continues reading, turning to paragraph 16.9.

## Combat (page 21)

#### Combat Setup (page 21)

When a story section ends with the word COMBAT, followed by a list of numbers, you must start a combat and defeat enemies before you can continue your story. Follow these steps to set up combat.

- Retrieve the listed enemy cards from the enemy deck. The deck should be in order, face down. Look through the cards until you find the listed numbers. (Do not look at the fronts of the other cards in the deck, only the backs.) Shuffle the cards you just retrieved and place them face up in a row in the center of the table, without any space between cards. (You may place these on the atlas if there isn't room on the table.)

  - Retrieve the 4 combat action tokens and distribute them among players.
  - Four players: each player gets 1 token.
  - Three players: the active player gets 2 tokens, the other players each get 1.
  - Two players: each player gets 2 tokens.
  - One player: the player gets all 4 tokens.

- Place each crew member's synergy token on their crew board.

#### Combat Rounds (page 21)

Start the first combat round and continue with combat rounds until either all enemy cards are defeated or all crew members have 0 health. A combat round consists of the following:

ATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK: Players may use their combat action tokens in any order. Each attack action is (often) followed by a counterattack from a targeted enemy. Attacking is explained in further detail below (pg. 23).

END OF ROUND: After all players have used their combat action tokens, all enemies that have not yet been defeated attack the crew and activate their end of round abilities (see pg. 24).

CHECK FOR VICTORY / START NEW ROUND: If any enemies remain, reclaim your combat action tokens and start a new round of combat. If all enemies are defeated, place them back in order in the enemy deck and remove all combat action tokens and synergy tokens from crew boards. Then complete your story in the storybook.

Giving Combat Action Tokens: Players can give each other unused combat action tokens, but each time a combat action token is given, one of the players (giving or receiving the combat action token) must pay 1 command.

### Combat Icons (page 22)

#### Enemy Cards (page 22)

Enemy Name, Level, And Number

> The enemy's name, level, and number are displayed in the center of the enemy card.

Enemy Health: Each heart must be covered to defeat the enemy.

> The Enemy's Health is indicated by the hearts displayed on the grid at the bottom of the enemy card.

Synergy Point: Cover squares with synergy points to gain bonuses. See pg. 25.

> Synergy points are depicted in the upper right section of the squares within the enemy's grid at the bottom of the enemy card.

Uncovered extra enemy attack damage.

> The attack damage sign, resembling an explosion, is situated in the box positioned above and to the left of the grid at the bottom of the enemy card.

Enemy Basic Attack Damage: This enemy deals 2 damage plus 1 or more for every uncovered attack symbol on their card.

> The enemy's basic attack damage is displayed in the center of the enemy card on the right side.

Enemy Defense Number

> The enemy's defense is indicated in the center of the right side of the enemy card.

The hourglass indicates an end of round ability. The "madness" symbol indicates a status token given to the crew during end of round damage.

> In this example, the madness symbol, resembling a purple swirl, is situated in the box located at the top center of the grid on the enemy card.

#### Accuracy And Enemy Defense (page 22)

Accuracy: Listed on crew weapons. Add to fate draw to attack an enemy's defense.

> The accuracy symbol looks like a skull with horns.

Enemy Defense: On enemy cards. Crew members must meet or exceed this number in order to hit an enemy.

> The Enemy Defense symbol looks like a horned skull with a shield.

#### Crew Weapon Layout (page 22)

Block: used only during enemy counterattack. Ignore 1 damage per block.

> The Block icon is located at the bottom right of the Crew board.

Accuracy

> The Accuracy icon is located at the bottom right of the Crew board.

Damage: This weapon deals 2 damage when it hits. Extra damage: You may discard 1 equipped savvy card (but not a level card) from this crew member to deal +1 damage when you attack with this weapon. You may not discard a card from hand to deal the extra damage. The ability card must be equipped to discard it.

> The Damage icon is located at the bottom right of the Crew board.

### Attack And Counterattack (page 23)

#### ATTACK and COUNTERATTACK (page 23)

1. First, place a combat action token on a crew member you control and choose one of their weapons to use. If a crew member already has 2 combat action tokens, they cannot attack again until the next combat round. (Remember: If you are the active player, you control Captain Odessa.)

2. Choose an enemy card to be the target of the attack.

3. Draw fate and add that number to the weapon's accuracy number. This total must meet or exceed the targeted enemy defense number in order to hit. Otherwise, you miss. After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy.

4. If you hit, place a number of damage tokens on the enemy card equal to the damage on the weapon you used. When placing damage on an enemy card, you must place all damage from the same attack adjacently (think of it as one slash or hit). You cannot place damage diagonally, and each square can only hold one damage token. You cannot place damage on or skip a square that already has a damage token. The damage does not need to be placed in a straight line (you can change directions, make "T" shapes, etc.). If every square containing a heart symbol is covered, the enemy is defeated. Return the defeated card to the enemy deck and slide any remaining enemy cards together so that they are adjacent.

5. COUNTERATTACK: If the enemy card you attacked was not defeated, it counterattacks immediately. It deals damage equal to its basic attack damage plus any uncovered damage symbols on its card. Place this damage on the crew member who attacked. Apply any block from the weapon you used, which lets you ignore 1 damage per 1 block. You may also use block from adventure cards and crew abilities at this time. If the crew member runs out of health, choose another crew member to take any remaining damage, and so on.

### End Of Round (page 24)

#### END OF ROUND (page 24)

Any enemies that remain after all players have used their combat action tokens now attack the crew and activate their end of round abilities (indicated by the hourglass symbol). Note: Players can choose to skip to the end of round phase even if they haven't used all of their combat action tokens in a round.

Each enemy attacks one at a time and in order from left to right, dealing damage to crew members.

- The active player decides which crew members are attacked by each enemy card.

- Damage from one enemy card must all go to one crew member. Status tokens can go to any crew member.

- Do not apply any weapon's block at this time. You can, however, apply block from adventure cards, crew abilities, or block that applies to "end of round enemy attack."

- If a crew member runs out of health while taking damage, any remaining damage must be dealt to another crew member, and so on.

#### End of Round Example (page 24)

The Skeletal Warrior and the Flying Eye enemy cards remain after the players have placed all 4 attack tokens. They have taken no damage, so all of their attacks are active. The Skeletal Warrior now attacks, dealing 2 damage to Mac. Next, the Flying Eye attacks, dealing 3 damage to Laurent and giving Marco a madness token.

Now players reclaim their combat action tokens and a new combat round begins.

### Other Combat Rules (page 24)

Missing: If you miss, you still get to deal 1 damage, after the enemy counterattack (you deal 0 damage in this case if you have 2 fatigue). Apply weapon block as normal to this counterattack. Abilities that increase attack damage can be used even if you miss.

Enemy Damage: Enemies deal damage equal to their basic damage PLUS any bonus damage on squares. If a square with enemy damage is covered by a damage token, this bonus damage is disabled.

Splash Damage: When placing damage on an enemy card, you may place some of it on adjacent enemy cards as long as it follows the damage-adjacency rule and at least half of the damage (rounded up) is dealt to the enemy card that you originally targeted. Designer's Note: This is a great way to deal damage to enemies that have a high defense number. Thematically, it represents using the chaos of battle against your enemies. You hit a minion, who falls back, causing a greater enemy to stumble while you make a quick stab. Or your hit throws the enemy minion and they flail backwards to catch their balance, accidentally hitting a comrade.

Flying: Enemies with a wing symbol have the flying ability, which means they have +1 defense against any weapons that do not have the "ranged" attribute.

Covering Enemy Squares: Each enemy square can only hold 1 damage token. When you place a damage token on a square, all abilities in the square are disabled. Example: Zoey covers a 1-damage ability, a "madness" ability, and a "flying" ability on the Flying Eye. Now it deals 1 less damage, does not give a crew member "madness" at the end of the combat round, and has normal defense against all weapons.

Double or Triple Hearts: Some enemy hearts have a number 2 or 3 on them. These hearts require a hit of 2 or 3 damage to cover (although you still only place one damage token on the square). See the example on the next page.

Crew Member at 0 Health: If a crew member who misses reaches 0 health during the enemy counterattack, they still get to deal 1 damage. The crew member can continue to use their abilities until the end of their combat action. After this, the crew member cannot participate in challenges or combat until at least 1 health has been restored.

### Synergy Tokens (page 25)

#### Synergy Tokens (page 25)

- At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member's synergy token is on the matching crew board. Note: when not in combat, these tokens do not need to be on the crew boards and you may place them to the side to save space.

- If a crew member ever places damage on a square with a synergy point (the red diamond), they place their synergy token on a different crew board.

- If a crew member has a synergy token from a different crew member on their board, they may return it to the matching board in order to use the ability listed on the token (this is called "activating" the synergy token). Synergy tokens can be activated after drawing fate.

- Crew members cannot use the ability of their own synergy tokens.

- A synergy token can be returned at any time to the matching crew member without activating it.

Synergy token abilities are explained in the box to the right.

Audrie: When activated, the crew member deals +1 damage during their attack.

Captain Odessa: When activated, the crew member may place damage diagonally.

Gregory: You may activate this token when the crew member reaches 0 health. Restore 2 health to the crew member.

Kannan: When activated, the crew member redraws fate during an attack.

Kasumi: When activated, the crew member deals +1 damage during their attack.

Laurent: When activated, the crew member deals +1 damage during their attack.

Mac: When activated, the crew member gains +2 accuracy during their attack. You may activate this after drawing fate.

Marco: When activated, the crew member can deal an extra 2 damage during an attack. This damage may not be placed on enemy heart symbols (but can be placed on enemy abilities and attack damage). This damage must be placed adjacently to the other damage in the same attack, as normal.

Rafael: When activated, gain 2 block.

### Combat Examples (page 26)

#### Attack Example 1 (page 26)

Jamey attacks the Scorpion Squid with Laurent using the Club. He places a combat action token on Laurent, then he draws fate. The result is 5. He has +0 accuracy, so 5+0=5, equal to the Scorpion Squid's defense of 5. The attack hits. The club deals 2 damage. Jamey decides to discard his equipped Triage card to gain 1 extra damage, for a total of 3. He must place all of the damage from this attack on adjacent squares. He chooses to use 2 of the damage to cover the bottom left square (he must use 2 because it is a double heart). He uses the third damage to cover the middle-left square.

The Scorpion Squid then counterattacks. It deals 2 basic damage plus the 1 uncovered damage ability on the bottom right square. 2+1=3 damage. Laurent's club gives 2 block, reducing the damage by 2, so Laurent takes 1 damage. Jamey places 1 damage token on Laurent's crew board.

#### Attack Example 2 (page 26)

Jamey places a second attack action token on Laurent so he can attack the Scorpion Squid a second time. He draws fate 6. He has +0 accuracy, so the total is 6, higher than the Scorpion Squid's defense of 5. The attack hits, dealing 2 damage. Jamey places the damage on the bottom right square and the middle right square. Covering the middle right square means that the Scorpion Squid's end of round ability, "Weaken," will not activate at the end of the combat round. There is also a synergy point on that square, which means that Laurent's synergy token can be placed on another crew board. Jamey places the synergy token on Audrie's crew board.

The Scorpion Squid now counterattacks. Because a damage token covers the bottom right square, the Squid deals only 2 damage. Laurent's club gives 2 block, so he takes 0 damage.

#### Combat Round Example (page 27)

Cid and Zoey are attacked by a Skeletal Warrior, a Flying Eye, and an Infernal Jackal. They start the first combat round. They each have two combat action tokens.

Cid goes first. He places his combat action token on Gregory and chooses to attack the Skeletal Warrior. He draws fate 5 and adds the number to Gregory's accuracy of +2, for a total of 7, equal to or greater than the skeleton's defense of 5. He then places 2 damage tokens on the skeleton, covering a heart and a blank square. The skeleton then immediately counterattacks, dealing 2 damage (1 basic +1 uncovered bonus damage).

Zoey attacks next. She places her combat action token on Captain Odessa and chooses to attack the skeleton. She draws fate 1 and adds the number to Captain Odessa's accuracy of +1 for a total of 2, less than the skeleton's defense of 5. She misses, so the skeleton counterattacks immediately, hitting her first. The skeleton deals 2 damage, but Captain Odessa's weapon has 1 block, so she only takes 1 damage from the skeleton (2-1=1). Captain Odessa then deals only 1 damage to the skeleton (because she missed), but it covers the skeleton's last heart, enough to defeat it. It also covers a synergy point, so Zoey places Captain Odessa's synergy token on another crew board. Zoey removes the defeated skeleton card from combat and returns it to the enemy deck. Note: Had Zoey hit the skeleton, she would have defeated it before it could have counterattacked, and she would have taken no damage.

After Cid and Zoey use their remaining combat action tokens to defeat the Infernal Jackal, the Flying Eye enemy remains and the end of round enemy attack phase begins. The Flying Eye attacks for 3 damage (2 base +1 uncovered bonus). Zoey is the active player, so she decides to place the damage on Mac. The eyeball also activates its end of round ability, "madness." Zoey places a madness token on Rafael.

Cid and Zoey then reclaim their combat action tokens and a new combat round begins.

For more details about specific combat and enemy abilities, see pg. 35.

Remember: Return enemy cards to the enemy deck in order.

#### Synergy Token Example (page 27)

Rafael places damage on the top right square and the middle right square on the Flying Eye. Because the middle right square has a synergy point icon, Rafael places his synergy token on a different crew board, this time on Gregory's board.

Gregory now attacks the flying eye. He misses, so the flying eye counterattacks first, dealing 3 damage. Gregory activates Rafael's synergy token and gains +2 block so that he can ignore 2 of the damage. He returns the token to Rafael's crew board.

## Other Rules (page 28)

### Quest Cards (page 28)

When the storybook says "Gain quest x," retrieve the matching quest card from the deck and place it face up near the atlas. (Keep all other quests secret and in order.)

When the storybook says "Lose quest x," or "Complete quest x," place the specified card in the used quest box. Once quests are in this box, you cannot retrieve them (unless you are reseting the game for a new campaign).

### Keywords (page 28)

Sometimes, a story will require you to have a keyword in order to read it, or you will need a specific keyword to make a choice.

Keywords are located on quest cards that you own. If you own the quest card, you have the keyword.

If a story paragraph starts with, If keyword X, turn to X, then you must follow these instructions if you have the listed keyword. If there are multiple keyword instructions at the start of a story, resolve them in order.

If a choice says Requires keyword X, it means that you must have a specific keyword to choose it. Even if you have the specified keyword, you are not forced to select that choice. You may select another choice.

Active Quest Symbol: This means that this quest is an active quest and you can travel somewhere to complete it. Quest cards without this symbol generally only need to be referenced when you check to see if you have a specific keyword.

> The Active Quest symbol, resembling a wave, is located in the center of the left side of the card.

Quest Description

> The Quest Description appears in the right center of the card.

Keyword

> The Keyword is displayed at the bottom left of the card.

Quest Card Number

> The Quest Card Number is displayed at the bottom right of the card.

### Defeat (page 28)

Your main goals in Sleeping Gods are to find totems and survive the dangers of the Wandering Sea. As you journey, there are a number of ways that you can meet defeat. Defeat means something different depending on the mode you are playing (normal or brutal). There are two ways you can be defeated:

- All crew member health is reduced to 0.
- The ship has 11 damage.

If playing normal mode, the game is more forgiving when you are defeated. In story terms, if crew members' health is reduced to 0, the crew somehow escapes, wandering back to port, but it takes days. If the ship takes 11 damage, the crew barely keeps her afloat, limping back to port for repairs, but they lose quite a bit of time doing so.

After checking a "defeat" box on your journey log, follow these instructions when you are defeated in normal mode:

- All crew reduced to 0 health: Move to the nearest port and remove all crew damage and fatigue. Discard 6 event cards from the top of the event deck. Start a new turn.

- Ship has 11 damage: Move to the nearest port and remove all ship damage. Discard 6 event cards from the top of the event deck. Start a new turn.

If playing brutal mode, the game is more realistic, ending in complete failure when you are defeated. The campaign ends and you must reset the game and start a new campaign to play again.

Make sure to mark any totems you found on your journey on the game achievement sheet. Write down your final score on your journey log (see pg. 34).

### Adventure Cards (page 29)

Adventure cards represent the people, equipment, knowledge, and totems you find on your journey. When you gain an adventure card, place it near the other adventure cards you own, face up near the ship board. You can use the abilities on these cards by placing command tokens on them (except weapons, which are explained below). You gain adventure cards by exploring or by purchasing market cards (market cards are a type of adventure card). ANY player can use adventure cards you own at any time, even to help another player in a challenge or combat.

#### Totems (page 29)

You must find as many totems as possible. The number of totems you find will determine the story finale at the end of the campaign. Totems have a special "totem" symbol in the top left corner of the card. All totems are adventure cards.

Command cost to activate the card. Place the command on the card when you use it.

> The Command cost of the adventure card is located in the center of the card.

Card Type And Adventure Card Number.

> The card type and number are displayed on the bottom right side of the adventure card.

You can activate this card to either gain 3 savvy during a challenge (after drawing fate) OR gain 2 block during combat. This card also has a "passive" ability, which means that it is always active and you do not need to spend a command to use it.

> This card is a passenger type. The description explaining how to activate the card is located in the center of the card, below the command cost.

This adventure card lets you redraw fate and keep the highest result.

> This card is an equipment type. It has a drawing of a hammer, rope, and lamp. It has the Redraw Fate symbol in the center.

This card is a weapon type. You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only the weapon info is showing.

> This card, categorized as a weapon type, showcases symbols for precision, attack damage, cunning ability, and blocking in its central part.

This is a recipe. When you activate this card, you can pay 3 of any type of food (meat, grain, vegetables) to remove 3 fatigue from crew members and remove 1 low morale status token.

> This card is a recipe type. It has a drawing of a soup. The description explaining how to activate the card is located in the center of the card, below the command cost.

When you activate this card, it gives a crew member +3 temporary block. You can only use block in combat. Block allows you to ignore damage.

> This card is a equipament type. It has a drawing of a vest. In the center, there are instructions for using it.

With this recipe, you must pay 3 grain. You may remove 3 fatigue and restore 3 health. You may divide these benefits among different crew members.

> This card is a recipe type. It has a drawing of some waffles. In the center, there are instructions for using it.

Market cards have a cost in the bottom right corner. Market cards are adventure cards that you can purchase using a "Visit a Market Location" action.

> This card is a equipment type. It has a drawing of a vest. In the center, there are instructions for using it.

When you activate this card, you may remove 1 madness from any crew member OR gain 3 savvy during a challenge.

> This card is a equipment type. The card has a drawing of an eye. In the center, there are instructions for using it.

Designer's Note: In the later stages of your campaign, it is likely that you will have twenty or more adventure cards. To keep the play area organized, you may wish to place some of the cards that you don't plan to use in a pile to the side. For example, you might own two recipes that are very similar except one of them is obviously better. In this case, you likely won't need the inferior recipe and can place it to the side, to clean up the play area.

### Campaign (page 31)

When you start a new campaign, write the players' names on a new journey log sheet. Also mark if you are playing normal or brutal mode. Use this sheet throughout the campaign to write down when you gain experience points (XP) and when you need to save the game.

On the back of the journey log is a map of the Wandering Seas. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to write notes on this map to help you remember things, such as where you've been, where you want to return, and more. If you know that a certain location requires a keyword, you can write this down as well so you know where to return when you gain the keyword later.

Sleeping Gods can only support one campaign at a time. This is because you need to keep track of which quest cards you have completed, current crew health and status effects, adventure cards you own, and more.

You may reset the campaign at any time by following the steps on pg. 33.

#### Saving the Game (page 31)

At the start of any player's turn, you can decide to stop playing and save your game. You only need to do this if you want to pack up the game. This is simply a way to keep track of your progress so you can continue another time. A campaign takes around 10-20 hours to complete, so if you have a dedicated space to keep the game set up, you do not need to save the game.

To save the game and pack up mid-campaign, follow these steps:

1. On the next available line on your journey sheet, write down your ship's location, the ship's current damage, and the last ship action that was used. Also write down which ability cards each player has in their hand, and how many unspent command tokens they have.

2. Place each crew board and all associated damage, status tokens, ability cards, level cards, and equipped weapons in a separate crew plastic bag. Place these in storage box 1 (see pg. 2).

3. Place all of your resources, coins, adventure cards, ability cards in hand, unused command tokens you own, and quest cards in the campaign box. When placing adventure cards in this box, put them in their own bag, and put any that have command tokens on them face down in the pile. Place the current event deck in this box as well.

4. Place the ability card draw deck in a plastic bag. Place the ability card discard pile face up in the bag (keep the draw deck face down). Indicate the bottom of this pile by placing a synergy token at the bottom.

5. Clean up the rest of the game components.

#### Setting Up a Saved Game (page 32)

1. Place the atlas in the center of the table and turn to the page of the location indicated on the most recent save line on the journey log sheet. Place the ship token in the listed region.

2. Place the ship board near the atlas. Place the ship damage markers as indicated on the most recent save line of the journey log. Place any resources and coins from the campaign box on the ship board.

3. One by one, remove the crew members and all associated tokens and cards from the crew bags. Keep all associated tokens and cards with each respective crew member. Place the Captain Sofi Odessa crew board near the ship board, in the center of the table. Distribute the remaining crew boards among the players as evenly as possible. Each player places their crew boards in front of them.

4. When you last saved, the ability card draw deck was placed face down, while the discard pile was placed face up. Now place these two decks near the atlas, but keep them separate.

5. Shuffle the market deck and place it nearby.

6. Place the event deck from the campaign box on the ship board.

7. Place your adventure cards near the ship board, face up. Place a command token from the supply on all adventure cards in the campaign box that were face down in the deck (indicating they had been used).

8. Place the deck of enemy cards near the board, face down (IMPORTANT: Do not change the order of cards in this deck and do not look through this deck unless instructed).

9. Place all of your current quest cards near the ship board. Place the magnetic card box nearby (IMPORTANT: Do not change the order of cards in the box, and do not look through the cards unless instructed).

10. Place all remaining tokens and the storybook near the board.

11. Shuffle the search tokens and place them in a stack, face down, near the board.

12. Decide who will be the first player. Give the starting player the captain token. Give each player their hand of ability cards and command tokens according to the most recent save line on the journey log (player 1, player 2, etc).

### Adding & Removing Players (page 33)

You can add or remove players at the end of any turn.

Follow these steps to add a player:

1. After the current turn ends, split up crew boards and assign them to each player as evenly as possible (except Captain Odessa, who is always controlled by the active player).

Follow these steps to remove a player:

1. After the current turn ends, reassign crew members to players as evenly as possible (except Captain Odessa, who is always controlled by the active player).

2. The player that is leaving must discard 1 ability card and all of their command but 1. The active player decides how to distribute the remaining cards and command token to the other players.

NOTE: Remember to turn the ship board to the correct side depending on the number of players in the game.

### Resetting THe Game for a new Campaign (page 33)

To reset the game for a new campaign, follow these steps:

1. Return all adventure cards to the adventure deck. Make sure all cards in this deck are in numerical order (starting with 1 when face down).

2. Return all quest cards to the quest deck (including quest cards from the used quest box). Make sure the cards are in numerical order (starting with 1 when face down).

3. Return all level cards to the supply.

4. Return all tokens to the supply.

### Variant: Dice (page 34)

If playing with this variant, you may roll a six-sided die any time you must draw fate, instead of drawing fate.

Designer's Note: Some groups may prefer this, but the downside is that it adds more chaos to the game. In the current system, you can manipulate your ability deck somewhat by holding onto low numbers in hand, or equipping low numbers to crew members so they are not in the deck. You can also make rough calculations based on how many 1s and 6s you've seen drawn (because 1s and 6s are half as common as other numbers). When using dice, you lose these benefits.

### Final Score (page 34)

At the end of the campaign, write down your final score on your journey log sheet.

- Gain 2 points per adventure card. Gain an extra 2 points if the card is a totem.
- Gain 1 point per quest card (include cards in the used quest box).
- Gain 2 points per level card.
- Gain 1 point per 2 remaining coins.
- Gain 1 point per remaining artifact.
- Gain 10 extra points if you reached an ending in the campaign.
- Lose 10 points per defeat (if playing normal mode).
- Gain 25 extra points if playing brutal mode.

### Ability Clarifications (page 34)

#### General Crew Board Ability Rules (page 34)

+1 Damage: This can only be added to an attack the crew member performs. The damage cannot be dealt by itself, and it cannot be added to another crew member's attack.

Block: You cannot use this to block damage dealt to another crew member.

+1 Accuracy: You cannot use this on another crew member's attack.

Remove Status: This can be used to remove status from any crew member.

+1 to Fate: This can be used on any fate card draw, even if drawn by another player.

Repair 1: Remove 1 damage from the ship when you use this ability.

Redraw Fate if 1: If you draw fate 1, you may use this ability to redraw fate.

#### General Ability Card Rules (page 34)

Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.

If an ability description says "you," it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped.

Instant Effect: Apply the effect the moment that you equip the ability card.

#### Specific Cards (page 34)

Surprise Strike: Discard the card to deal 1 damage (no enemy counterattack). You do not need to draw fate or use a combat action token to deal this damage.

### Enemy Abilities Clarifications (page 35)

### Achievements (page 36)

Whenever you find a totem, mark the appropriate box on the achievement sheet. When you complete various campaign endings, mark the specified endings boxes on the achievement sheet. As you discover totems and endings, you gain "unlocked cards".

#### Unlocked Cards (page 36)

Unlocked cards are specific cards in the quest deck. Mark the unlocked cards you achieve when you have the specified number of totems/endings.

Examples: To gain the unlocked cards "quests 169-170," you would need to have discovered a minimum of 4 totems/endings. To gain the "quests 167-168" unlocked cards, you would need to have discovered a minimum total of 7 totems/endings.

Each time you start a new campaign, check the achievement sheet to see which unlocked cards you start with. You do not gain these cards during a campaign, only when you start a new campaign.

Once you have gained an unlocked card, it forever remains "unlocked" and you can use it in all future campaigns. You may choose which unlocked cards to use at the start of each campaign.

### Enemy Level Difficulty (page 37)

Often before combat starts, you can see the level of the combined enemies. Here is a helpful chart to give you a general idea of how difficult the combat will be.

> This table shows how the combat level corresponds to the difficulty level.

| Combat Level | Difficulty |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| 3-8          | Very Easy  |
| 9-11         | Easy       |
| 12-13        | Medium     |
| 14-17        | Dangerous  |
| 18-22        | Deadly     |

### Exploring a Town/City (page 37)

Some stories start with a town or city name in bold. In this case, the story structure often allows you to select all of the various choices in the same visit, one by one. You may not, however, select the same choice more than once during each explore action at the town/city.

When you explore this location (40), the story starts with the town name "City of Ashes."

> The name of the town appears on the map as a scroll.

### Explore Tokens (page 37)

Sometimes a story will say "gain explore A," or another letter. In this case, gain the explore token with the appropriate letter. Follow the instructions if a paragraph mentions a specific explore token.

When you return to the ship, return all explore tokens to the supply.

### A Note On Rewards (page 37)

The words "materials" and "vegetables" are short for "materials token" and "vegetables token." Each token represents a variety of building materials or vegetables. "Gain 1 materials" means "Gain 1 materials token."

### Strategy Tips (page 37)

- Remember to equip ability cards early on in each event deck. They drastically improve your ability to succeed at challenges, but it's easy to forget to equip them. Also, at the end of each event deck, you'll have to discard all equipped ability cards, so it's a good idea to equip them early on in each event deck.

- If you find yourself constantly running out of health or have too much fatigue, use the ship's deck action more often so you can get food. Use your recipes, and go to the market to get better recipes that more efficiently replenish health and remove fatigue.

- The further you venture from the starting region, the harder things get. If you are having trouble surviving, try to obtain a few useful adventure cards and buy one or two level cards before venturing to a new map.

### Crew Board Suggested Layout (page 39)

Place equipped ability cards in the top two slots. (This is to remind you that you may not equip more than 2 ability cards per crew member.)

> The ability cards are positioned at the bottom left of the crew board.

Equipped Weapon Cards

> The equipped weapon cards are positioned at the bottom right of the crew board.

Place level cards below equipped ability cards, like this (unless there are no equipped ability cards, in which case you can place them directly beneath the crew board). An easy way to tell ability and level cards apart at a glace: level cards have a yellow strip on the bottom and ability cards have a turquoise strip.

> The level cards are situated below the equipped ability cards.

### Rule reminder: what players share (page 39)

#### Resources that each player does not share: (page 39)
