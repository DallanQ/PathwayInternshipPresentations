https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3271748/i-have-2-questions-about-combat-one-is-about-allow	Square is ok because one damage is placed next to previous and not diagonally, but now I wonder if 4 damage could be placed as a T shape? After all every damage is next to another but definitely not from previous...	A T is allowed. Its even used as a specific example in the rules.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3269600/travel-to-new-page-with-movement-left	When travelling to new page, does movement stop automatically on the new page or can I continue to move if I have more movement left?	You can continue moving.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3266861/audries-power-block	"But why does it say that ""Audrie's 2nd crew board ability gives +1 block""?"	Some of the crew abilities can be used in combat. Audrie's second now gets an additional +1 block so you can use it in combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3250276/when-doing-a-challenge-can-i-not-use-a-crew-member	Do you give all the damage to one designated crew member and move on to the next crew member, or do you split the damage up little by little?	Damage must be applied to any crew members that participated first. Since no crew participated, damage goes to whoever you want.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248892/when-i-do-an-ability-test-can-i-look-at-the-cards	When I do an ability test, can I look at the cards already used in advance, calculate the success probability more, and then draw the ability cards?	Yes, equipped and discarded ability cards are public so you can calculate the odds.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248851/you-spent-one-of-two-action-actions-to-explore-the	You spent one of two action actions to explore the port and progress through the story related to it. And do I have to spend one more action to take a port-related action (such as resting) at that port?	Taking an Explore action and taking a Port action are both separate actions so doing both would be all you could do on a turn. If you already spent two actions, then you'll have to wait until next turn to take a Port action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248842/do-crew-members-who-attack-using-combat-markers-in	Do crew members who attack using combat markers in battle get fatigue tokens?	No.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3230374/combat-with-no-healthy-characters	Halfway through a combat one player had both of their characters go to zero health. What happens when we start a new combat round? Do their combat tokens just get wasted?	In that case the combat token is wasted unfortunately.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3223758/some-questions-about-the-game-rules	Command tokens can be spent to use an equipped ability card. But that only makes sense if the team member has at least one life point left, right?	If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health.	
 	Combat round end ability on level card: 1 defense. Does this apply to the team or only to this team member? And only if this team member has been damaged?	This card is specifically about the damage that enemies do at the end of a full combat round (so after all 4 combat token have been used, see step #2 in the Combat rulepop). If you assign some (or all) of this damage to the crewmember with that specific ability card, then that crewmember receives 1 less damage.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3221166/level-cards-artifacts-and-more	Can I use Artifacts as coins?	Yes, artefacts can be used as coins.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3210769/adventure-card-command-tokens	  Is the player able to keep activating the same adventure card if there is already command token on it, by placing more command tokens each time?	Once a card has command on it, the command token(s) must be removed before it can be used again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3208566/few-more-questions	If an ability card requires an activation token to use (say to give +1 damage), I'm assuming it can be activated as many times as you have command tokens, as each token to activate ability card goes back to supply right?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3208566/few-more-questions	Can a person without a ranged weapon that does a damage of 1, still destroy the wings of a flying enemy? Or does it just void the entire attack?	Yes. The “Flying” enemy ability just makes it more difficult to hit if you don’t have a ranged weapon. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#enemies	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3208566/few-more-questions	For the level up cards that trigger when certain things happen (use the bridge, explore, etc), do they trigger when any player does this, or only the player who controls the crewmember? For example if player 1 controls Laurent and Laurent has the level card that grants a command when using the bridge, what if player 2 visits the bridge?	Rules for Ability Cards generally apply to Level Cards also. Essentially a level card is a special type of ability card. So, “Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.” https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#ability-cards	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3206341/where-does-the-captain-go	Where does the captain go?	"The active player is always the captain.There is a ""Captain"" marker that the active player can have each turn to help everyone remember who is the actual captain for the turn."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3201053/losing-during-a-battle	If, during a battle, I manage to slay some of the enemies but then I lose, if I will go back to that battle in the future, does it mean that the enemies I have killed don’t take part in the battle anymore, or are they revived and I have to kill them one more time?	You set up the battle from scratch and fight all enemies again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3198679/some-simple-questions-after-first-session	When we lose a challenge, who gets the damage?	Damage and Status effects are applied to those crew members who took part in the challenge before non-participating members.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3198679/some-simple-questions-after-first-session	The manual tells me, that first the participating team members get damage. So, when do non-participants get damage?	If all participating crewmembers are knocked out, then any remaining damage must be allocated to non-participating crew.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3198603/failure-of-combat	So what happens if we fail combat and everyone dies?	Everything auto-failed. And yes, you can go back and explore again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	when using command, if my partner has a character who’s attacking, can I spend command on my characters boards to help benefit him? Like I can spend say two command to give their character +1 accuracy or extra damage? And same thing using adventure cards (if I have more command than them I can say pay a command to do a card that will benefit them)?	you need command to add on or more of your character to a challenge but not for fighting anyone can use adventure card or crew ability AFTER drawing the fate (challenge or combat)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	when discarding an equipped ability for +1 in combat, there was an ability strength card that had as text when discard for combat add 1 damage. Would this be in addition to the modifier on player board? So Raphael discards strength ability for +1 normally. In this situation would it have given 2 (1 for discard and 1 from card text)?	yes 1+1	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	what if in 5) card was different, giving some passive effect. Would that effect still work for this one attack when discarding this card?	yes 1+1	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	"The german rules after finishing the event deck say: ""after drawing the last card of the event deck, the active player ends his turn."" That would mean he skips the action phase completely. Is this true or is it an errata?"	This is correct. The special end-of-act event replaces the Event phase of the next player's turn (so no event card is drawn, you read the indicated passage in the book instead).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3183513/event-deck-and-discard-pile-reset	What happens to the event discard pile at the end of the first age?	When you create a new event deck, the original discarded one is removed from the game and the cards are not used again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	Can you do the challenge without choosing any crew member to participate in it?	You can do the challenge even without choosing any crew member to participe in it ; so you would have had to try the challenge again and automatically lose it, which would have make you lose more health. When you fail a challenge and lose health but no crew member was participating, you chose how you want to dispatch the damages between your crew members, so the two remaining would have also died at some point	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	What happens if no crew member participates in the challenge?	If no crew member participates in the challenge, you only look at the fate number on the card but don't apply any bonus you would have gained from a crew member

No, only active characters. It's not stated directly, but is implied in the challenge example: > Determine the sum of the specified skills on participating crew members (which is usually 1 per crew member plus any relevant equipped ability cards they have) and move to the next step.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3157128/how-to-deal-with-results-of-a-challenge-if-no-char	How to deal with results of a challenge if no character assigned	If no crew are assigned to a challenge or travel, you can spread any damage and effects among the crew any way you wish.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3143866/card-stone-of-blood	According to the rules of the game, a command token may be spent at any time. This should also apply to the time of the combat, right?	You are correct. Adventure cards can be triggered outside of a character strike/attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3143866/card-stone-of-blood	"Would it then be allowed to activate the adventure card ""Stone of Blood"" immediately before the outbreak of combat in order to cover a field on an opponent card?"	You are correct. Adventure cards can be triggered outside of a character strike/attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3129703/exhausted-event-decks-after-era-1-what-happens-aft	Exhausted event decks after “era 1”, what happens after?	You don't re-shuffle events, you take new ones. Events you already saw should be discarded and not come back.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3129703/exhausted-event-decks-after-era-1-what-happens-aft	Should you write down keywords even if it doesn't make thematic sense?	It depends on the player's preference. Some players choose not to write down keywords if it doesn't make thematic sense to them, preferring to keep the gameplay more in line with the story's logic. Others write them down regardless, focusing on the gameplay mechanic rather than the thematic aspect. It's a matter of personal choice and how it affects your enjoyment of the game.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3108633/does-synergy-carry-over-between-combat	Does synergy carry over between combat?	"No it is specific to that combat.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3098780/frightened-to-0-health-character	Frightened to 0-health character?	Yes you can. Only restriction for applying statuses is they can't go on someone with that state already. Or if it is a story effect that specifies a named character...then it must be applied to that character. But even then, if that named character already has that effect, then nothing happens (no one else takes the effect). There is nothing against this in the rules, so it should be fine.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3083930/equipped-ability-cards-using-matching-symbols-to-a	After the ability card is drawn to determine fate for a CHALLENGE can any crew member, including those that have not participated in the challenge originally, spend a command token on an equipped ability card to boost the fate number by 1 if the symbol matches the challenge type?	Treat the symbols on any cards equipped to characters as if they were printed on the character board... they increase that characters stats. There is no need to spend command to activate those symbols.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3083930/equipped-ability-cards-using-matching-symbols-to-a	Do symbols on equipped ability cards automatically get added to the fate count or must they spend a command token on the equipped ability card/discarded to the supply to add them?	Symbols on equipped ability cards automatically get added to the fate count. There is no need to spend command tokens.

Any card symbols on crew NOT participating will have no effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Ship Actions - can ship actions be activated in any order (e.g. draw card, retrieve tokens, get tokens).	Yes Ship Actions can be applied in any order (Rulepop).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Travel - can you travel using a crew member of another player?	Since travel is a CRAFT Challenge (but with a maximum of one crew member committed), I assume another player can pay a Command to use one of their crew members.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Can another player discard Craft Ability Cards from their hand to boost the total?	Since travel is a CRAFT Challenge I assume another player can discard Abilities cards to boost the total.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Can you activate abilities on other player's Crew or Crew Ability Cards?	"Check out the clarification for usage of the word ""You"" on Ability Cards. I think this would apply to Crew Abilities also. So, No — you can only activate abilities for crew members you control."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	So during combat, when I use a Combat Token, it's effectively my turn, and we can't use any abilities on another player's Crew? And other players couldn't spend a Command to do so (like they can with Challenges)?	Command can be spent at any time, even on another player's turn. So, to help each other during combat you could: * Activate a crew ability or ability card ability that can affect another crew member, like Mac's +1 to a Fate Draw (though there aren't a lot of these) * Equip an ability card from your hand to any crew member. * Activate an Adventure Card * Give or receive a combat action token (so that a crew member could attack twice) I hope that's helpful.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3079310/combat-question-dmg-token-placement	In general, do I have to place tokens adjacent to the last one placed (1-2, 2-3 etc.) OR can I place tokens as long as they are adjacent to ANY one token placed this attack (first, second, third, fourth etc.)?	You must place them one after another, in a row. So 3 adjacent to 2, 4 adjacent to 3 and so on so forth if you have more.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3079310/combat-question-dmg-token-placement	Can the non-active player use abilities (both on crew board and equipped ability cards) when it's not their turn (separate from using crew skill icons for a challenge by spending a command point). If so, is there any restrictions on this? During combat? During a challenge?	Yes, they can. The only exceptions are that recipes can't be used while in combat, and adventure cards that move the ship can't be used while in combat nor while exploring. Otherwise, all players can activate adventure cards, crew board abilities, and ability card abilities during any player's turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3058777/can-i-equip-an-ability-to-another-crew-member-once	Can I equip an ability to another crew member once equipped?	You can change the owner of a weapon anytime outside of combat. Ability cards, however, cannot be changed. The Rulepop Command reference mentions you can discard equipped ability cards at any time. You can get rid of them, but you'd have to wait until they cycle through the deck in order to reacquire and equip them to someone else. Nope. You cannot swap ability cards once equipped.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3057695/artifacts-what-for	Artifacts - what for.	They are another type of resource (like meat, grain, material etc.)  you can find in the game. These tokens can be spent as 2 coins at any time. There are also some special locations that allow you to spend artifacts to gain rare treasures or effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3047439/who-can-be-targeted-by-some-ability-card-abilities	Who can be targeted by some Ability Card abilities?	Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3041159/for-gain-quest-155-is-the-quest-completed	"For ""Gain quest 155"", is the quest completed?"	If I remember correctly, that card has a keyword on it. You keep that card as a token, as a reminder of what results you achieved. The keyword will be referenced by other stories and thereby influence them. Quests only go into the box when you're instructed to discard them. Some quest cards represent the start of a quest and the keyword opens up new story options. Other quest cards represent the end of the quest and they stay in your hand to block alternate story options.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3040505/discard-this-equipped-card-to-skip-an-event-card-s	Discard this equipped card to skip an event card - Skip the effects of the card, or do not draw an event card?	The card isn't skipped - you just don't do the event on the card. This prevents a time-skipping exploit loop. Adventure cards and the like can be used at any time, so it's assumed this one could be too since it's not challenge-based. The answer is to look at the event, and decide if you want to change your fate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037556/traveling-to-a-new-map	"The rule book says ""traveling to the page as indicated by the blue arrow ""But how about the arrows where there isn't a number ?"

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Can I sell unused Ability cards or just discard them? either way, do I shuffle them back in the Ability card deck?	They have no monetary value. You only discard them into the discard pile.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Are Ability/Adventure cards a 1 time use? or are they reusable?	Depends on the card and how you use it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Is there a limit to how many Level cards I can equip with the same character?	No. But they may only use their own Level cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	If I can't swap equipped Abilities, can I at least discard them? (let's say I would like another Ability from my hand instead)	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	When I discard an Ability card from my hand to get +1 for a challenge, does it matter if I use a different challenge icon on the Ability card then the challenge I'm currently doing? (like discarding a Strength Ability card in a Cunning challenge)	It needs to match the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Can I discard more than 1 Ability card for the same challenge?	Pretty sure you can discard more than one but I can't check the rules at the moment.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Where do I put the Event card after I'm done with it? is there a discard pile?	Discard it. It won't be used again this campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035910/setup-question-give-each-player-1-command-and-one	"What is a ""command card""? Or does it mean ""command token""? In regards to the ability cards, do we just get dealt one randomly... or???????"	"It means to give one command token and one ability card. When the rules refer to gaining or spending those tokens, they are simply referred to as a ""command"" rather than a ""command token"". For the ability cards, one is dealt to each player off the top of the deck."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035910/setup-question-give-each-player-1-command-and-one	When can I cook a recipe?	Any time, except during combat (rulebook page 18). “During combat” means any time after you’ve looked at the enemy cards and before they are defeated. If you see there is combat about to happen, the game rules allow you to eat before fighting (thematically, you ate the food before the fight started).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022338/when-monsters-atack	When in a combat you have done your 4 attacks and then is the monsters' turn to attack, who do they attack? Who gets the damage?	The active player decides which crew members are attacked by each enemy card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3019810/doubt-event-card	When a card asks you for a challenge and for it you do an action, does that mean it has to be one of the two ship actions? Or can you do that challenge at any time?	Yes it’s an action. I don’t have the card in front of me, but some events make you do it right away, others apply a negative effect until you remove it with an action at your choice of time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018777/items-that-give-block	"For items that give block (such as the serpent scale vest in the rulebook), does the item give that block bonus for one hit?  Or for the entire combat?  I realize it's ""temporary,"" but I'm not sure how temporary."	It only applies to a single attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018065/when-using-the-stone-of-blood-does-the-bonus-damag	When using the Stone of Blood, does the bonus damage have to be placed continuously with other damage or can it go anywhere on a monster card?	The adventure cards can be used 'at any time,' meaning they don't have to be part of a specific attack, or even part of an attack in general - they are a separate instance of damage. This damage can be combined with the total damage of an attack, applied to a different non-contiguous square or on another monster, or even used before an attack to disable a monster ability.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018065/when-using-the-stone-of-blood-does-the-bonus-damag	Can Stone of Blood (45) be combined with an attack that does 1 damage to cover a heart worth 2?	Yes. The Stone of Blood is dealing 1 damage, not +1 damage. You can use it to snipe a damage out without suffering counterattack, or combine it with your attack to hit a 2 or 3 heart space.	
  	in comabt - can I use other member abilities?	Generally, the attack based abilities (+1 damage, +1 accuracy, block, etc.) can only be used by the crew member themselves. Some other abilities, like ones that remove status effects or affect fate draws can be used for anyone. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#crew-board

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3012264/omg-new-to-the-game-and-can-t-find-the-answer-in-t	What happens when a single crew member has no health left?	 They don't die, they just can't do anything. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health. Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt.

No. Except the specific Quest Card unlocked depending on the number of totems you don't keep anything. So, no totem.

Also, can there be ""negative"" numbers?"	1) You are not allowed to repeat a specific story choice/decision in the same Exploration action.  This is outlined in the rules. 2) Challenge results never go less than 0.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3008936/paying-fatigue-when-a-crew-member-is-specifically	Paying fatigue when a crew member is specifically named in a challenge?	"In general, specific crew are just mentioned as flavor text and you don’t have to use them specifically. It may depend on the specific section though. I’ve seen some challenges that specifically *restrict* a character from participating, but I don’t think anyone is ever compelled to. In this case it specifically said that a crew member was attempting to navigate the ship to safety, then in the actual challenge it said that only this crew member was allowed to be used. It didn't state that you had to use him, but as the flavour text had mentioned that the crew member had been attempting to steer the ship already it felt a bit like I had to use him. Not to use him would had felt a bit meta-gaming in my opinion and this is why I wondered if I was also obliged to place a fatigue token on him according to the rules.Anyway, thanks for your replies. Navigation doesn’t require a crew member to participate, so I would say it’s that crew member or no one.  If that crew member was already over fatigued then it would have to be no one. It says you don't have to, so you don't have to. Fatigue and skill checks are about effort. How much effort did he do? More or less? I know the check you're talking about. The point isn't to make you use him, the point is he's the only option if you try to use anyone. I think saying to not use him is metagaming is ignoring unambiguous instructions they gave you  They give a lot for instructions like that so I'd be worried you're unnecessarily tying your hands a lot in the game. If this is a reoccurring thing in the game then on the one hand I would say it's important for me to get the answer to this question, as I will most likely get stuck on it every time it happens in the future otherwise. Secondly I would say that if they are going to keep mentioning specific crew members and in the ""narration"" refer to them performing an action which - according to the rules - I actually don't need to assign them to, then the rules could probably need some rewriting on this point.Again, thanks everyone for answering my question."

Zero points per market card. Since they're much easier to get than adventure cards, you're not rewarded for having them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3006784/do-you-have-to-use-1-command-token-per-low-morale	Do you have to use 1 command token per low morale!	A crew member can have only 1 of each type of status-token. So a crewmember can never have 2 low morale.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3006772/does-venom-activate-outside-of-combat-as-well	Does venom activate outside of combat as well	Yes. Poison is real bad.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	When I place a command token on a character ability to activate it, how long does that stay active?	All abilities, whether they are from character boards, adventure cards or the small cards (can't remember their name) are one time use. So, if you block one damage using an ability, you block a single damage for the cost of 1 command, that's it. No less, no more.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	Also, having venom in a solo game kinda sucks right, as every turn its one damage i assume.	With venom, “The crew member takes 1 damage at the start of each player’s turn.” So, the number of players doesn’t change anything.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005524/end-of-combat-round-enemy-attack	If I’m playing 2 player.. and i am the active player, can i send this damage over to one of player 2’s characters?	Yes. In combat, all players are considered active and can use the combat tokens in any order as well as spilling excess damage to other crew members (regardless of which player controls them).

When to lose a fatigue, remove the one with the penalty side up first if you have one, then the blank one the next time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3002094/adding-and-removing-fatigue-tokens-french-translat	Equipment: Armors should be equipped into a crew member or captain, or are available as generic option as cooking recipes?	Armour cards (like weapons) must be equipped (given to a crewmember) to be used by that crewmember.

If there are still permanent level cards (like ""gain a ship damage on every Fate 1 unless you solve a Strength 8""), will these be removed as well?"	Ongoing event cards (like the one you describe) remain after each run through of the event deck until you've run through the event deck 3 times and thus completed a campaign. Most of the ongoing event cards have actions on them that you can take either as one of your 2 actions or at the end of your turn to attempt to resolve them. Since they stick around when you make a new event deck, I find it's generally good to get rid of them relatively soon.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3000221/clarifying-some-rules	When attacking an enemy with wings, with a regular weapon (not ranged); if I decide to apply the damage to the wing first, does the +1 defence for the enemy still apply? E.g. I can do 3 damage to an enemy with a regular (not ranged) weapon. Does the wing still require 2 damage?	Crew members must meet or exceed an enemy's defense in order to hit it with an attack. If you hit, it doesn't have any effect on damage. So, an enemy with fly ability is more difficult to hit if your weapon isn't ranged. Each flying icon in the enemy grid should only take one damage to cover. Once they're all covered, the enemy no longer has the ability.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3000221/clarifying-some-rules	Do characters die in battle?	The characters don't die but, according to the rules 'Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2997393/solo-game	So I play with all the crew members. Why I use fewer ability cards? It’s written on the rules?	Yes: rules say that 1 ability card per player as a starting point (and not crew member). Later on, there is a limit of 3 per player - so in solo that is still 3 max!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2995206/weapon-says-gain-low-morale-when-used	If my weapon says when used gain low morale, does this apply to the weapon holder and the weapon is unusable if they have low morale, or can the low morale be given to a different crew member when using the weapon?	"If it's just the Low Morale symbol, you can give it to anyone.  If it says ""This Crew Member"" it has to be the one using the weapon.  You can play it either way.  I would justify it as either the weapon makes the user feel like it's stealing their soul so they gain low morale.  OR. if another character gains the Low Morale, that crew member can be terrified of the other crew members power.  Kinda like Sam watching Frodo fall to the power of the ring."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2992406/what-happens-to-defeated-enemies-when-all-crew-is	What happens to defeated enemies when all crew is down to 0 health	Damage of enemies is only tracked with the fight itself.

Do you shuffle the ability deck at that point?	They are discarded but you’re not instructed to shuffle. So no, you have to wait till the deck runs out. There are multiple copies of each card though I believe.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2991132/ability-and-level-cards-also-skills-on-crew-boards	After playing through a campaign (54 event cards), do my crew members get to keep their level cards for the next campaign?	Level cards do not carry over to the next campaign. I agree that some are terrific and some of them are pretty underwhelming. But you’re going to be getting plenty of XP no matter what. So you might as well grab them for the Skill symbol if nothing else and make challenges easier.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2991132/ability-and-level-cards-also-skills-on-crew-boards	I'm still unclear on when I can use the printed skill symbols to assist in a challenge. If another crew makes a strength challenge, can Rafael add in his strength point after fate has been drawn?	You have to declare who is part of the Challenge and spend Fatigue prior to flipping the card. That’s part of the risk/reward. You can play skill cards from hand AFTER you draw fate to modify though (as well as spend command to action cards or character abilities).

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2971238/what-means-the-plus-before-the-accuracy-number-ob	The rules said: Draw 1 ability card and gain the specified number of command tokens. It seemed to me that it was about the specified number on the ability card, but now I understand it isn't..	For clarification on Rulespop: Ship room effects vary depending on the number of players in the game. When a room shows two numbers over the command token symbol, check the player count symbol at the top right corner of the ship board. This tells you what amount of command to take (depending on the number of players).Player Count When playing with 3–4 players, use the side of the ship board that has this symbol.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2919349/can-you-use-adventure-cards-and-crew-abilities-if	Can you use adventure cards and crew abilities if they have command tokens on them?	You cannot use crew abilities (any) or normal ability cards if they have command one them. The command would need to be cleared first.A weapon typically does not have an ability like an ability card and does not get command on it. You can recognise that by the command icon (the blue token).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2908405/using-command-during-combat-from-another-character	Can I use command from a crew ability that is not participating on an attack to give accuracy or even more damage to the attack?	Generally speaking, no. There are a few crew abilities that can be used on other characters (such as the fate/status ones) - but the combat-related ones (damage/block/accuracy) can only be used on that specific character when they are making an attack.https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#crew-board

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905767/kasumi-s-synergy-token	Why would I cover empty spaces? I don't get why it would help since we cannot skip spaces. It doesn't help with adjacency for another hit right?	you would not want to cover empty space, but sometimes you can not avoid it.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905767/kasumi-s-synergy-token	I think Rafael has one level up card that allows him to only have to place 1 damage on his initial target and then he can place the rest on an adjacent enemy. This way, you can use an enemy with low defense to land the hit, and roll over damage into an enemy with a high defense.		
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904637/travel-test	To travel we need to do a craft challenge. It's I can choose only one crew member for that test. Is that a regular difference among other action and types of challenges in the game? Do I need to memorize these differences?	Only one crew member is used for travel, but you don't have to use a crew member. Travel is different than other challenges as it is an action.https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#travel	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904637/travel-test	Also the negative effects always have to go on a character that participated on the challenge? Or can I give to someone else?	Negative effects are applied to crew that participated first.

It's #1. Discard as many as you can. Read the paragraph, (which will tell you to create a new deck of 18) Then discard the rest of what you owe off of the new deck.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2896109/defeated-in-normal-mode-and-event-deck	"One thing I do not understand is that it specifically tells you to discard 6 cards from the event deck AFTER you build the new deck, which means pretty much ""discard all mild event cards"". Why don't the rules just say to discard the mild event cards when creating a new deck of 18 cards? Am I missing something here?"	The 6 cards that I discard when defeated are supposed to be the time while I go back to port. If I cannot discard all 6 cards and the deck is empty, I have not come back to port yet and I am still unconscious when reading paragraph 1 and facing the monster. If, on the contrary, even if I have not discarded 6 cards yet when the deck is empty, I am supposed to be recovered, this is not coherent with the 6 discarded cards simulating the time I spend coming back to port, isn’t it?

Not certain, but I believe frightened stops you from choosing that character. They weren't frightened when you chose them. Their miss still causes 1 damage, they become frightened, and you can't use them again in combat until frightened is removed.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2893834/search-token-low-morale	Which test? I did not performed any test. I was just in the ship action (deck).	It means you found 1 coin and 1 character gets low morale.Since you are playing solo, you can assign low morale to any of your characters.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2889652/crew-abilities	During a challenge, is it only crew members who are assigned to the task (and got fatigued) who can use their starting abilities (or equipped ones) to help swing the outcome after the fate draw, or can any crew member use their abilities effects to help so long as they pay the command cost?	It depends. If it says 'you', then only the player drawing a fate card can use one of their committed characters.

Thanks in Advance.	You get the 2 cunning every time; the command cost is 1, as you say; but you add all the extra abilities for equipped ability + level cards, to the base on your character sheet, for no additional cost.

It means any character can pay 2 command to place any character's synergy token on another player. It allows you to get a character's token into play without them having to fight, and without anyone having to mark a synergy space on a monster. Useful for example to put Gregory's token on a player just before they take damage that would reduce them to zero health.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2866449/adventure-card-88-clarification-spoiler	Can you do this outside of combat to set this up ahead of time, or only once combat has commenced?	Not a good idea, as setting up combat places each character's synergy token back on their own board.

No, from the wording of the synergy token in the rulebook, it's when the crew member hits 0. It's too late if they already are. I use this as protection usually for a crew member that's low on health, but a heavy hitter. Where they would be reduced to zero after an attack, if they have Gregory's synergy token they use it so as not to be defeated and possibly make another (victorious) attack.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2849626/regular-challenges-vs-travel-challenges	Is it correct that for the craft challenge performed during the travel action, you can use at most one crew member?	Yes, you can only use 1 crew member for the specific Craft challenge during the Travel Action. This is because thematically, only 1 person can ultimately pilot the ship at a time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2849626/regular-challenges-vs-travel-challenges	Are any or all of these intended to be deviations from the normal challenge procedure?	Yes, the deviations are intended. For the Travel Action Craft challenge, other players cannot support you with their crew members, and there are specific rules about discarding ability cards and using crew and adventure cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2848775/skipping-the-combat-end-of-round-phase	Does this mean I can choose to use only 3 of my 4 combat action tokens, when there are still enemies that are alive?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844304/assigning-command-tokensadventure-card-resources	Can I assign my personal command tokens to another players crew member in order to activate their crew abilities or cards, or are players only able to assign command tokens on their OWN crew members/cards?	You can only use crew board abilities of crew members under your control	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844304/assigning-command-tokensadventure-card-resources	When using adventure/market cards to heal or remove fatigue, can this be split amongst players and or crew members, or is it only for the player placing the command token on the card.	All benefits from all adventure cards can be assigned to any and all crew members, including spreading benefits from recipes among crew. So adventure cards are not limited to your own crew.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844043/newb-questions	Am I the only one struggling with this rule book? I feel like there a lot of things missing. Or maybe I just suck at finding them.	"Not at all!When we started to play, it seems a lot of stuff in the rules were taken for granted that you knew. It felt like Ryan Laukat believed that we've all played his earlier games.I would love to continue the game, but we have to find a really precise ""how to play"" on youtube first. The rule book simply doesn't cut it.We've also read it from start to finish and had a lot of questions."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2843686/unexpected-leak-sea-serpent-plus-defeat-in-normal	So basically if I get defeated while playing normal mode and go back to port; should i keep the recurring event cards like the sea serpent / leak ones or they get discarded?	You've played that right. By RAW these stay unfortunately.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2841162/possible-to-re-gain-a-completed-quest	Possible to re-gain a completed quest?	If you've already gained a quest, then you can't gain it a second time, so if the storybook instructs you to gain that same quest again, you just ignore that part.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838484/how-to-re-prepare-the-event-deck	How to re-prepare the event deck	You only discard the 6 event cards if the crew was defeated or the boat was destroyed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838484/how-to-re-prepare-the-event-deck	When we finish the event deck and read the proper paragraph in the story book, it says to create a new event deck. Elsewhere in the rules, it says to discard 6 event cards. I'm confused about this. Since there are normally six mild event cards on top, if I have to discard six, why would I even bother shuffling the mild event cards?  Why doesn't the storybook say anything about discarding six cards?  On the 3rd time through, do I discard 12 cards?  What exactly is the proper procedure for re-preparing the event deck?	Should your crew of ship be defeated, that's when you discard 6 events cards. but not beyond the current event deck (i.o.w.: they don't carry over into a new event deck). In terms of rebuilding the event deck: we tend to set aside used events, and only build the deck with new 'fresh' events.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838292/enemy-ability-reference	Is there a list of enemy abilities and their descriptions? I can't seem to find anything in the rules.	Check the bottom of the Enemies entry at the Sleeping Gods rulebook page 35.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838292/enemy-ability-reference	What are the implications of shuffling the Search Tokens each time players save/restore?	The order of Search Tokens, which normally are only shuffled when they run out, matters. Instructing players to reshuffle these tokens each time they save/restore could have gameplay implications, especially since the order is supposed to be significant.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838292/enemy-ability-reference	What is the suggested house rule for handling market cards?	The suggestion is to create a market stack tied to the market at that location in the atlas instead of sending un-purchased cards to the bottom of the deck. This would allow players to return and purchase items they previously couldn't afford, giving each market a unique personality.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838085/is-it-a-totem-or-an-achievement-or-both	Thank you, I don't think I explained my question very well though - on the left hand side it has a column that says 'achievements' then on the right there's a column that says 'totems' - if a card is in the achievement column is it a totem as well? Why is it not in the totem column? And additional question do you get all the cards in the achievement column for the new campaign or just the unlocks that you got from the totems and endings? And if it's not a totem and you don't start with the cards why is the column there and they're just not another adventure card? I don't understand what the achievement column is basically.	They aren’t two distinct columns, it’s just poorly organized headers. It’s more, Achievements/Totem List. Note that the list is alphabetical and continues from column to column.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838085/is-it-a-totem-or-an-achievement-or-both	So if I unlock a Totem, do I have the totem card when I start a new campaign? and if so, how do I know that when I gain a quest that would give me that totem card again? I would get nothing for my effort	No. Unlocked cards are different. Totem cards (and everything else except the special unlocked cards) go back into the deck. See the bottom of the achievement sheet. So if you have 4 totems at the end, you unlock quest cards 171 and 172. If on your next playthrough you find one or more totems again, they don't count double. So you would need at least 3 new totems crossed off (total 7+) to unlock cards 169 and 170.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2834346/command-tokens-in-combat	Can one player pay command tokens to boost another player's turn in combat?	The rules say you can spend command at any time (with a few specific exceptions) so I'm pretty sure that yes, you can.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2834346/command-tokens-in-combat	You're probably talking about activating adventure cards that provide extra aim or shields? Yes, I believe you can pay command to activate that during another player's combat turn.	I don’t think so. Combat is way more restrictive on spending command on other players attacks and being attacked than other situations. And pooling command is also impossible.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2832316/order-of-play-after-first-event-shuffle	Order of play after first event shuffle	Yes, that's correct. Finish the current turn as normal by taking your two actions then continue as usual.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831931/experiencelevel-cards	Can u have as many level cards as u want in each character?	Yes. There is no limit on the number of level cards per character. Only limited by the experience you're able to gain.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831400/location-29-minor-spoiler	Does this mean I can sell four items of the same type (like 4 Status Tokens) or do I have to sell one item of different types (like 1 Material + 1 Artifact + 1 Food)?	yes, you can sell 4 of the same type.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831400/location-29-minor-spoiler	Moreover, since I can’t find a rule that prevents you to explore the same location twice in one turn, is it possible to explore location 29 twice in the same turn in order to sell more than four items (obviously Status Tokens) for coins?	you can explore the same location twice on your turn, but each explore costs you 1 action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	When do adventure cards become refreshed?	This does not happen automatically. Some of the ship actions (Bridge, Quarters) allows you to remove all/certain number of command tokes from the cards/player boards, making them ready to use again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	In which case, when are the command tokens removed?	You get to keep the adventure cards for the entire campaign; i.e.: the three rounds of event cards. Once your campaign is done and you have one of the endings, you reset the game, with the exception of any rewards you might get that carry over.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	Is there a different game mode in the Tides of Ruin expansion?	The Tides of Ruin expansion has an Arcade mode that allows players to play random generated journey rather than from the story book.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	Is the map provided in the game searchable?	Note that this map (pdf file) is searchable. Makes it easy to figure out what page a location is in.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	What happens on brutal mode if you are defeated?	Only on brutal mode that you ending the campaign when defeated. On easy / normal mode, you back to the port, lose some events, etc and continue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826357/question-about-activating-sofi-odessas-crew-abilit	Question about activating Sofi Odessa's crew abilities during combat	You did indeed play it wrong.The major misconception that I read in your post (though that may just be the wording)  is that the captain is shared among players. This is not the case. The captain is controlled solely by the active player. So she isn't shared but rotated. Also, giving command tokens to other players is not allowed.Note that it is allowed for other players to activate adventure cards on your turn. So in the situation above another player could have spent a command token to activate an adventure card giving you additional accuracy.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826357/question-about-activating-sofi-odessas-crew-abilit	Am I right in thinking then that if one player has a glut of command tokens, they should just spend one to take someone else's combat action token just in case an ability like this could be useful?	Correct on both counts.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2821451/each-time-when-i-use-up-a-deck-of-event-cards-shou	Each time when I use up a deck of event cards should I return them to the box?	Read the text in the storybook. It will tell you exactly what to do after you've completed the relevant section. For example, at the end of story 1 (which you read after you've depleted the event deck for the first time) the story tells you to construct a new event deck from the event cards that were unused (so the ones left over after you assembled your first event-deck).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2821451/each-time-when-i-use-up-a-deck-of-event-cards-shou	When I prepare the new deck should I randomly draw from the rest of 36 cards or from the 54 cards? And second time, should I just use the rest of 18 cards?	From the rest of the 36, and then use the remaining 18. When I finish each round of the event deck, I place those cards on the Completed Quests' box so that I don't mix them up until the end of the campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2820281/can-i-spend-command-in-the-middle-of-a-ship-action	Can I spend command in the middle of a ship action	I'm pretty sure you can. The rulebook says you can spend command at any time.  Yes, I believe you can... you can spend command between the different ship action tasks... just not in the middle of one of those tasks. Once you start removing command, you need to finish that part of the ship action. (So, you couldn't remove command, gain and spend command, then continue removing.) I'd say this more often comes into play if you have a full hand of cards. Then you might want to gain command, spend command to equip a card, then draw cards. (Because as soon as you draw over your hand limit, you must discard back to your hand limit before doing anything else.)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2819669/is-the-effect-of-recipe-or-other-adventure-cards-l	Is the effect of recipe or other adventure cards lasting?	All adventure cards require you to put a command on them to activate. So they're usable only once until you remove that command token (via a ship action).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2815126/exploration-question	When you explore, and you read a paragraph from the book, sometimes it's a challenge, so you have to choose one or more characters to participate and give them fatigue tokens. If there's negative effects, they get some and then you can give damage to the rest of the crew.Sometimes though there's no challenge connected to an attribute, just a choice to make, do I have to choose a character to participate again and give them fatigue tokens? In which case this character gets the negative effects /rewards?	For any challenge, you can choose to not have any crew members participate and simply move on to the draw fate step. Negative effects for failure are applied to participating crew members first (divide as you see fit). Any negative effects that can't be assigned to participating crew members then get applied to any eligible non-participating members (again, you choose how to divide amongst them).If there's no challenge, just a choice, then no crew members are participating in a challenge. No fatigue tokens are given. Assign any negative effects of the story to any eligible crew members.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2814313/hunting-serpent-card	"The rules for this card (pg. 12) states that ""as an action"" you can fight it. Does this refer to one of the 2 Actions available at the end of your turn? Or is it a Challenge?"	Yes, it is 1 of your 2 actions. So you would need to spend an action to attempt the challenge. This was confirmed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2810718/challenge-and-crew-member-abilities	Hey, i have to clarify one thing before going on to play solo: I need to make a challenge and choose two of my crew members. They’ll get their fatigue tokens. I am able to activate one (or two, or three…) of my other crew members (not participating) „crew member ability“ right? Without getting a further fatigue token or paying a further command token (except the command token costs from the ability card.) Sorry if that was already answered somewhere else. I searched for it but didnt find the exact „setting“.	Abilities, yes, you can. (though I'm unsure which ability you would use in such circumstances, maybe some re-draw ability ? )	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809483/interupting-ship-actions	If I'm doing the ship action Bridge: can I take the Command, then spend it on an adventure card ability, then finish the Bridge action by returning the Command to the supply?	This interrupts the ship action, so no. After resolving everything for the chosen Ship action, you can spend Command before you go to Event phase.[Edit]: Though the way you played is supported by other players - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2607837/article/37080527#37080527	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809353/combat-token-placement	Combat token placement?	In the rules, players can give each other unused combat action tokens, but each time a combat token is given, one of the players (giving or receiving) must pay 1 command. This implies it's per round, not just once for the entire combat. If you don't have the command, then those tokens can't be used. Additionally, if Player A was the active player when the combat started, they can still place tokens on the Captain, unless the Captain is also at 0 health.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	Does this mean the crew members I control, or any member on the table?	"Context is important, but it normally means the crew which one player controls. For example, Rulepop says: ""If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped."" Was there a specific use case or rulebook sentence to which you were referring?"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2805304/questions-about-adventure-cards-and-fights	But how long is the Cloak of Ulo active?	Adventure Cards are not 'active'. They provide no benefit until used. To activate the card, pay its Command cost, then apply the effect. The Cloak can be used to block 3 points of damage once by spending a Command point.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2805304/questions-about-adventure-cards-and-fights	If we use Odessa two times in the same fight, does it continue to be active?	Each crew member can have up to 2 combat action tokens, so Odessa cannot be used 4 times in the same Combat round.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2805304/questions-about-adventure-cards-and-fights	On that same thought, like in combat does as much damage as possible have to be placed on a single character and any overflow all onto a single other character, etc.?	"Yes, during combat all damage dealt by a single enemy attack (counterattack or end-of-round attack) must go to a single crew member. If doing that causes that crew member to get knocked out then the remaining damage must be applied to a single other character, repeating as necessary. See the ""Counterattack"" section here."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2802859/crew-board-abilities-question	Can you use a crew member's ability if they are knocked out by damage?	Unfortunately, no. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health (from the Sleeping Gods Rulepop reference). However, they can use their abilities during the action they are knocked out of battle. For example, if Mac misses during combat and is knocked out, she still attacks for one damage, and you can still use her ability to pay 2 command for one extra damage. But after you move on from this combat action and attack with someone else, you wouldn't be able to use any of her abilities.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2801274/can-fate-abilities-be-used-in-combat	Can fate abilities be used in combat?	I'm positive abilities that redraw fate cards can be used during both combat and challenges, though Kasumi's redraw fate ability is restricted to the player who controls her. Your example of Kasumi and Mac works, but your Kasumi couldn't help a character under someone else's control redraw.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2798520/using-non-active-audrie-to-travel-need-to-pay-1-co	If the active player decides to Travel, and the non-active player agrees to have Audrie participate in the craft challenge, does the non-active player need to pay 1 command, as would be the case in a normal (i.e., non-Travel) challenge?	Yes they would need to pay 1 command and place a fatigue on Audrie.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2796381/do-ongoing-cards-leave-the-play-area-when-the-even	Do ongoing cards leave the play area when the event card deck runs out?	It depends on the card. Some of them will direct you to remove it when the deck runs out. Some won't. The cards will indicate when. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2795611/travel-clarification-can-you-split-travel	Are you allowed to split your travel action with an explore action?	"Under travel it specifies ""for each distance you may move to 1 adjacent region."" You can always move less if you overshoot the CRAFT challenge score needed to travel to your destination, but it makes no allowance to bank extra movement. Unfortunately, you'd need an additional travel action after your exploration to do so."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794525/question-about-splash-damage	On the rule book it says I can do splash damage as long as I deal half of damage to the monster that I targeted.So what does it mean half of damage?Is it the amount of damage (quantity of enemy’s heart) or just damage token that I’m supposed to put on the enemy card?	Good question.  I'd say it's the damage.  The rules say at least half of the damage must go on the targeted enemy - not 'half of the damage counters'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794525/question-about-splash-damage	"Can I piggyback a question on this?  Can you place a counter on a ""blank"" space on the targeted enemy, to give you the half damage you need, to splash some to an adjacent enemy?"	I can't think of any rule or reason why you can't. We've done that a few times in our encounters.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2793408/can-level-cards-be-counted-as-skill	can level cards be counted as skill?	Yes, we definitely count them. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any reason for them to have skill icons.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2791576/counter-attack-and-block	Can any player pay for adventure cards?	Yes, any player can spend command to activate adventure cards to help themselves or the active player.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2787199/can-ability-cards-be-discarded-from-hand-voluntari	Can ability cards be discarded from hand (voluntarily without discard text)?	Discarding can be done only if you reach your hand limit, I think. In this case you would replace one of the 6 with the new ability card.Otherwise you have to make sure to use high number ability cards in the challenges.One of the ship actions allows you to discard an ability card from your hand to get rid of one fatigue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2785424/crew-board-ability-use-in-combat-dead-character	can I utilize a crew members board ability when they themselves are passed out?	You can use abilities till the end of the combat round, but can't participate in combat thereafter.

"I would argue that ""activates at the end of each combat round"" implies immediately at the end of the round.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2777631/can-an-ability-card-be-equipped-during-a-ship-acti	Can an ability card be equipped during a ship action? Specifically after gaining command, but before gaining a new ability card?	YES, this is a valid play! The long answer is: there’s a combination of rules which covers you here. Rulepop says: Ship action effects can be applied in any order. Rulepop says: You must pay command to … equip ability cards to crew members. You may spend command at any time, even on other players’ turns. You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge. Which fits your scenario nicely. BTW, you may NOT draw a 4th card, decide to equip one of them, and keep the remaining 3. Rulepop says: If after drawing new Ability Cards your hand size has exceeded the limit, you must immediately discard down to 3 cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2774095/status-token	Can you put a status token on a crew member that’s dead? Or exhausted already?	As far as I know yes, but remember that status tokens usually end up on characters who participated in challenges or combat, and if your character is totally exhausted or at zero health then they probably aren’t able to do that stuff in the first place.

For example, monster has three health remaining. My attack does 2 damage. Can I or another player spend command to activate an adventure card for an extra damage to kill the monster before the counterattack occurs?	Yes. It's the same point at which you would use a character ability to supplement your damage / hit diagonals / discard skills. I haven't played in a minute, but we're talking bombs and poison, right? Makes thematic sense to play them as part of your 'full' attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2750800/when-can-people-spend-command-tokens-and-on-what	When can people spend command tokens and on what?	1) Any player can spend command at (basically) any point to play one of their own ability cards in front of any crew member's crew board. 2) Players can spend command tokens to activate their own crew board abilities for their own crew. They cannot spend command tokens on other players' crew boards. 3) Players can spend command tokens at any time to activate adventure cards. 4) Players can spend 1 command token to take a combat action token from another player or give a combat action token to another player.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2750800/when-can-people-spend-command-tokens-and-on-what	What are the restrictions around spending command tokens on abilities attached to equipped ability cards?	Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card. Therefore, if the equipped Ability helps with a Challenge, that Crew must be participating in the Challenge to help. If an ability description says 'you,' it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped.

If the text said nothing, but the person has left thematically, either keep the card or house rule it and put it to the Used quests. You should never put a card back in the magnetic box."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738225/location-190-g-and-her-gcs-spoilers	Out of curiosity, was this quest acquired on a Tides of Ruin expansion map?	This quest is from the base game map.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2735968/official-solo-rules	"One of the threads here mentioned the ""Official Solo Rules"".  I can't find anything similar anywhere. About the only thing I stumbled across was a discussion where someone preferred playing solo as if they were two players each with 4 crew. As far as I can tell playing solo just means starting with one command token and with a single hand of cards, still with a hand-size limit of three.. Are there any specific special solo rules?"	"Those are the official solo rules you mentioned. Some solitaire players prefer to play two-handed (or more) where you get more cards (overall) but have to use command to use the ""other"" players characters on ""your"" turn, and so on."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2728099/when-a-crew-member-loses-all-health	If a crew member loses all health, does he or she die?	No, you just can’t use them for combat or challenges until you heal them, I believe. They’re considered to be on the verge of losing consciousness. It’s in the rule book.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2720124/how-do-you-place-combat-damage-on-enemies	How do you place combat damage on enemies?	"You pick! Every new attack you place damage where you want to as long as it is not on top of or skipping previous damage, but all damage for that attack has to be placed adjacent and orthogonally. For that initial attack, you place it wherever. As said, the attack can start anywhere (on the enemy you targeted). One rule we forgot initially is that at least half of the damage (rounded up) need to be placed on the target enemy - limiting your splash damage potential. Also remember that cards giving you a standalone attack like Chloroform (or some passengers, etc.) are considered a standalone attack that does not have to be adjacent to anything. On the other hand, the ""add 1 damage to attack"" cards/synergies will just increase your normal attack and adjacency rules do apply."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2718140/healer-remove-status-token	When i go to the healer? Does the healer remove status tokens as well?	The healer just patches your wounds and heals you - unless instructed otherwise, status conditions persist until something tells you specifically to remove them (like character abilities, items, and a few other methods).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2711287/level-cards	Is there a limit to the number of level cards a character can have? Or can they, assuming you accumulate enough xp, get all of their level cards and benefit from them all at once?	There is no limit on Level Cards, only on Ability Cards. So, a character can end up with all of their Level Cards + 2 Ability Cards equipped.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2711287/level-cards	Can any player spend command to activate an adventure card like Scoundrel's Gear to give +2 cunning during a challenge, or is only the active player allowed to do that?	Any player is allowed to spend command on Adventure Cards at any time, so we did allow any player to activate these during challenges.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2705777/can-you-explore-the-same-location-multiple-times	Can you explore the same location multiple times?	"Yes, it's possible. Otherwise, you will receive a quest card including a word which would let you skip this action. You can explore as many times as you want, but each time is one of your actions. To limit abuse of this: You get only 1 resource on the ""infinite"" combos. (not worth the action unless you're desperate) Good rewards will be blocked with a ""quest"" keyword that sends you to a different paragraph without the rewards. While you are exploring one area that offers you multiple choices and bring you back to square 1 (typically: cities and villages), you can pick each option maximum 1 time. But if you go back to your boat and explore again the location, indeed you get to pick again an option you took before. Most locations give you a keyword (or make you lose a keyword) that makes it so the second and further times you explore that area you have a smaller exploration action. Typically you can get food or materials, or have a combat again (the tentacled beach on the first page is a good place to gain some experience and meat early in the game), but every time you take an action this way you're spending time that you are not using for exploration and totems-hunt."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2692555/crew-abilities	Does a crew member have to be participating in the challenge in order to use their crew ability?	You can spend command at any time, even on other players' turns. This includes spending it to activate crew board abilities to help in challenges (even if you’re not the active player). And you can use the crew board ability even if the crew member didn’t “participate” and gain fatigue in the previous step of the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690600/lose-food-but-no-food-unfulfilled-demand-eg-rotten	"With Rotten Supplies, if we have 0 food going in, are we allowed to ""throw out 0 food"" and carry on with no downsides?"	"Yes, thematically, if there's no food, there should have been no fungus on it in the first place, so it's okay to throw out all 0 food. However, the rulebook's differentiation between ""pay/spend"" and ""lose"" might not be explicitly stated, leading to some confusion."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690600/lose-food-but-no-food-unfulfilled-demand-eg-rotten	From the Event rule section, what happens if you don't have two foods to discard for an ongoing event like Rotten Supplies?	If you don't have two foods, the rot continues. Thematically, there's always 'food' on the ship for the crew, and food resources represent extra stock/reserves. In such situations, it's suggested to always keep a bit of extra everything.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2688585/discarding-surprise-strike-when-equipped-to-kasumi	Would Discarding Surprise Strike while equipped to Kasumi when dealing damage allow for +2 damage?	"No. From the rulebook (p.34): ""Surprise Strike: Discard the card to deal 1 damage (no enemy counterattack.) You do not need to draw fate or use a combat action token to deal this damage.""Surprise Strike does not add damage to an attack you're already making; it's a separate 1-damage attack. (That's why the card's damage icon has a '1' and not a '+1' like Rafael or Mac's board abilities.) You can discard it at any time to deal one damage, or you can discard the skill for its Cunning after a successful attack to add one to Kasumi's total damage - not both."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2687514/ability-cards-fate-and-abilitys-on-crew-members	Can I use the top ability of the crewmember board and an ability on a skill card which I add to this crew member or can I use e.g. both, the Skills and the Ability on the board?	You can use as many abilities of your Crew & all Adventure Cards as you can afford to pay Command for and which are not blocked.Crew Board Abilities and Adventure Cards retain Command when used.  While they are blocked with Command Token(s), they cannot be activated.  So each Crew can use one of their abilities once before they have to have that Command removed, then they can use any one of their abilities again.  The Ship Actions with the Command icon and curved arrow are used to return blocking Command to the supply, thus freeing Crew Boards and Adventure Card abilities to be reused. (There may be other ways but this is the most common route of getting Command off cards/boards and back into the supply.)Ability Cards attached to Crew do not retain Command.  Command spent to activate Ability Cards goes straight back into the supply. See (Rules, pg. 18) for more details on spending Command for abilities.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683876/challenges-step-3-can-you-use-abilities-on-chars-n	Can you use abilities on characters not participating?	Yes, abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card. However, the language on some cards, such as Mac's World Lore, suggests they can be used during any challenge, whether the crew member is participating or not. This interpretation allows for more flexibility in using abilities, especially for expensive level-up cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683876/challenges-step-3-can-you-use-abilities-on-chars-n	Do you only get to use abilities on equipped ability cards if you also participate by taking the fatigue?	No, participation is mainly for deciding which characters' skill icons you are adding to the fate card value. It also affects who takes damage from challenge failure penalties. However, abilities on equipped ability cards can often be used regardless of whether the character is participating in the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683876/challenges-step-3-can-you-use-abilities-on-chars-n	Does the 'Redraw Fate if 1' ability on Kasumi's Crew Board apply only if the active player controls Kasumi?	No, the 'Redraw Fate if 1' ability does not strictly require the active player to control Kasumi. It is interpreted that the ability can be activated by the active player using command on Kasumi's card, allowing the active player to redraw fate. This interpretation is supported by a discussion in another thread, indicating flexibility in using crew board abilities even if the crew member didn’t participate in the previous step of the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2682748/defeat-and-status-removal	Any chance we remove status effects after character defeat, just like injuries and fatigue?	Unfortunately, no, unless you want to house rule it. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#defeatFWIW, the further you get into the campaign, the more adventure cards you can collect to help you remove statuses, in addition to the crew abilities you start with.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2682748/defeat-and-status-removal	Now that we're talking splash damage; do you place the enemy cards from left to right in numeric order at the beginning of combat, or do you get to choose how to place them?	"Rulebook Pg.21-Combat Setup: ""Retrieve the listed enemy cards from the enemy deck. The deck should be in order, face down. Look through the cards until you find the listed numbers. (Do not look at the fronts of the other cards in the deck, only the backs.) Shuffle the cards you just retrieved and place them face up in a row in the center of the table, without any space between cards."""	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2682748/defeat-and-status-removal	What about crew board ability and equipped ability cards?	From the way the rulebook reads, you can equip an ability card to any crew member (even those of other players), but in order to activate crew abilities, the player that controls that crew member is the only one who can activate it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2678456/question-regarding-the-4-grey-combat-cubes	Is it possible for a player’s character, for example Mac, to have two grey combat cubes during a round of combat?	Yes, the restriction is that a character can't have more than 2 combat action tokens on them (i.e., you can't use Mac to attack 3 or 4 times in a round, but 0, 1, or 2 is perfectly fine): rules pg. 23 If a crew member already has 2 combat action tokens, they cannot attack again until the next combat round.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677902/extra-weapon-damage-limited-to-one-card	Does this mean you can ONLY discard one equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage?	Yes, the rules imply that you can only discard one equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage, as indicated by the specific mention of discarding '1 equipped savvy card' for the extra damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677902/extra-weapon-damage-limited-to-one-card	Or could you potentially discard two equipped savvy cards to deal +2 damage?	No, based on the rules, you are limited to discarding one card per attack for the extra damage, due to the specification of '1 equipped card'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677902/extra-weapon-damage-limited-to-one-card	If it said 'you may discard an equipped card' rather than '1 equipped card', would the interpretation be different?	Yes, if it were phrased as 'you may discard an equipped card', it might suggest that more than one card could be discarded. However, the use of '1' indicates a limit to the number of cards that can be discarded for extra damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677902/extra-weapon-damage-limited-to-one-card	What is the limit of discarding cards for extra damage?	The limit is one card per attack for extra damage, specifically an equipped savvy card, not a card from hand, and it must be equipped to be discarded.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677902/extra-weapon-damage-limited-to-one-card	Can you discard cards from hand to gain the extra damage?	No, the rules clearly state that the card must be equipped to be eligible for discarding for extra damage, thus cards from hand cannot be discarded for this purpose.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2676516/can-you-assign-damage-to-any-character-from-a-end	Can a active captain  pick who will get the hit from each monster?	If you play with a friend and are captain this turn, makes sure you assign damage to his crew. It is a coop game, so you should mutually decide where the damage goes. However, the active player does have the final word in case of a disagreement. All the damage has to go to the same crew member (until they reach zero health, in which case all the remainder goes to another crew, etc.), but statuses can be assigned elsewhere.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2674665/when-does-the-event-deck-reshuffle	"When does the event deck ""reshuffle""?"	After the event deck runs out, it gets remade (reshuffled) as part of story progression. That happens twice!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2669198/question-regarding-bold-attempt-ability-card	I assume this card has to be equipped, correct?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2668301/ongoing-events-and-reset-of-the-event-deck	Is there any reason to hope that my ongoing events go away after resetting the event deck? Or do I still have to deal with them?	The rules tell you how to handle this at the top of page 11. There should be instructions on the card to tell you how to get rid of it, or when the card expires.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2664014/how-many-times-can-a-crew-member-attack-in-one-com	How many times can a crew member attack in one combat round?	Yes, provided they use two combat action tokens.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2662467/where-to-put-status-gained-from-an-event-card	Where to put status gained from an Event Card?	If there is no challenge involved then it could go to any crew regardless of who controls them. If there was a challenge draw and one or more crew members were given a fatigue token, so as to add their skill bonuses, then the status is assigned to one of those crew members. however if there was a challenge and nobody was assigned to the draw, then it is free assignment once again. If there is more than one status or damage involved they do not have to go to the same crewmember unless they are the only one that participated.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661731/event-card-explanation	Can you help me understand this card? Can I instantly do the challenge and discard it? When you do the action, is the effect of the card active? I mean when I do the 6 savvy and I draw fate for the final result, should I gain -1 health and 1 weakened? Is this action replaces the one of the two actions I have to do on my turn?	You have to use one of the 2 actions every player gets each turn after the event phase. If challenge is failed, the second action can also be used for that. Until someone succeeds in that challenge, anytime you a fate card shows a 1, the crew suffer the effect listed. Remember that -1 Health and Weakened can go to different crew members, which is decided by the active player. You leave this card face up next to your shipboard and it remains in effect until then. You do not have to do it that specific turn. You can do it on a later turn as well, but will continue suffering the effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661332/can-i-use-multiples-of-a-crew-ability	Can I use multiples of a crew ability?	No, because on certain ability cards, you don't put the Command Token on the card, you just discard the token, that's why you can reuse the card. Whereas with crew abilities, you place the command token on the used ability, preventing you from using it again until it is removed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2660308/discarding-fate	When I drawn ability card for purely a fate check, do I add the card to my hand or discard it when done? I see nothing about discarding, but I’m not convinced I keep it either.	You discard it. Discard. I don’t think of it as drawing a card, but rather flipping the top card into the discard, like a die roll. That was my instinct as well, but I saw nothing saying to discard. Thanks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659771/when-is-the-middle-of-combat-for-ability-card-purp	"When is ""the Middle of Combat"" for Ability Card Purposes?"	It'd be nice if the enemies waited around until you made your selections ... I'd say once you determine that combat will occur, the prohibition begins. Someone may think differently, but that makes most sense to me.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659771/when-is-the-middle-of-combat-for-ability-card-purp	When can I cook a recipe? In the middle of a noncombat challenge? In the middle of an exploration before making a choice? After reading text?	Any time, except during combat. “During combat” means any time after you’ve looked at the enemy cards and before they are defeated. If you see there is combat about to happen, the game rules allow you to eat before fighting (thematically, you ate the food before the fight started).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659537/list-of-ability-card-questions-and-answers	A crew member attacks, misses, then resolves damage first due to the Rapid Strike ability. During the damage resolution, I discard Rapid Strike to get +1 damage. Does the damage still get applied first?	Yes. Once you’re in the “apply damage” phase, you can use various abilities and discard cards, but it won’t modify what combat step you’re in.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659000/level-cards-and-challenges	"When level cards are equipped to crew members, do these ""count"" as additional values when performing challenges? Like a level card with a savvy icon for Laurent - would that mean when performing a savvy challenge with Laurent I have +2 (+1 from his mat and +1 from the level card)?"	"Yes, level cards add to a character's skills for challenges, etc. The only thing you can't do with level cards is to discard them to power up other abilities, like you can with regular ability cards. Level cards, once equipped, are permanent - but don't count against the ""limit"" of 2 ability cards per character. Challenges become significantly easier as you progress."

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648879/question-about-story-1-spoiler-for-going-through-f	Normally, when you are defeated you mark a defeat, remove all damage and go to the nearest port.What happens after you fail story one, except remove all damage? Do you also mark a defeat and move to port?	Yes, you do the same thing. You do not have to repeat 1 or 1.1, but just move on with the campaign. Don't forget to discard the top 6 cards of the newly formed deck. Or rather do not even bother adding the 6 easy events to the top.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	"When the rulebook says ""any crew member"" (e.g. removing Fatigue in the Galley, removing damage in the Sick Bay), should I assume it always means ""even crewmembers controlled by another player"", unless specified? Or are there any big exceptions to this?"	"Yes.  ""Any Crew"" means any of the crew, including the Captain and crew controlled by other players."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	For example, can I buy weapons and equip them to crewmembers I don't control? What about the Inn? does it heal all crewmembers, or just the ones I control? etc.	Yes, you can equip weapons to any crew, at any time*, and they can be moved between crew members (your own or other player's).  The Inn heals all crew, not just the ones you control.*except during combat. (Rule Book, pg.29)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	Can I spend Command tokens on things such as Adventure cards in the middle of resolving a Ship Action? For example, when performing the Bridge Action - can I draw my ability card from it, use Gloria to draw two more, THEN perform the rest of the Bridge Action, removing the command token from Gloria?	Yes.  Each part of a Ship Action (draw cards, heal, gain Command, etc.) is discrete, and other things can be done in between.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2643658/fatigue-and-fatigue-tokens	"If i gain 1 fatigue, i take one fatigue token with the blank side up. If i gain second fatigue i flip my already blank token. From now on does this count that i have two fatigue tokens, so i can no longer participate in challenges? Or does the rulebook means ""two physical cardboard tokens"", so 1 flipped, and 1 blank (3 fatigue) and then i cannot participate in challenges?"	You take a second token, flipped. When you remove 1 fatigue, you remove 1 token (the flipped one first). Having 2 tokens also reminds you of your character's fatigue level when you need to pack the game away and bring it out another day.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2643658/fatigue-and-fatigue-tokens	Is this true? If my crew is at max fatigue, the ability bonuses to challenges are essentially free?	No... You can't ever use a crew member who has two fatigue in a challenge (except for the Captain with her level card). What Fire_Forever meant is that if the action result gives you fatigue (i.e. as a consequence of success/failure), you can ignore that.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2641030/order-of-ship-actions-details	Can you equip an ability card with gained command and then take a new card?	Yes. Ship action 'effects' (gain command, gain card(s), heal, gain resource(s), etc.) are separate and can be done in any order desired. (Rule Book, pg. 10)  Other 'any time' actions like using Adventure cards can also be done in between parts of the chosen Ship Action. (Rule Book, pg. 16 & 29)

Likewise use Spicy Gumbo, for any 2 food, to cure 5 hearts and remove 3 fatigue?	The cook book can only be used once per turn using any one recipe. Next turn you can clear the command and use it again. You can still use another command and use the same recipe on the same turn if you want, but using the full food requirement.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640098/cooking-questions	For 1 command and no ingredients, I can remove 1 fatigue and cure 4 hearts! Is this so...? And, can these be done on any character or it needs to be on one character?	Yes, that is all basically correct!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2638251/unlocking-cards	When you unlock cards at the end of a campaign, do you count all totems from previous playthroughs or just the ones in the playthrough you just completed?

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2634456/inactive-player-using-crew-abilities	During a challenge can inactive players use crew abilities; even if they did not spend a command token to allow their crew to participate originally?	No. If you look at the crew abilities explanation detail on the official rules faq it specifically states you cannot use certain crew abilities on other crew mates unless specifically stated. For example, you cannot add combat values to other crew members but you can cure status ailments or redraw fate or repair the ship etc.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2634456/inactive-player-using-crew-abilities	Is there one crew ability you can use on other crew mates?	Yes, the 'remove status' ability can be used on other crew mates. You can find the full explanation here https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2634456/inactive-player-using-crew-abilities	Can you use combat abilities or Kasumi's +1 fate ability to help other crew members?	No. You cannot use combat abilities (+ to accuracy, damage, and block) to help other crew members and you can't use Kasumi's +1 fate ability unless she is involved.

Does that person first get to take a ship action?	You complete that person's turn then turn to entry 1. After completing the actions of entry 1, it is the next player's turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2625329/event-deck-depletion-spoilers	Is the sequence of completing a person's turn then turning to entry 1 stated anywhere in the rulebook?	"Rulebook page 12 second 'box'. After the heading 'First Time': ""After you have drawn all the cards from the event deck, first the current players turn."""	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2625329/event-deck-depletion-spoilers	How is the gameplay sequence after the event deck is depleted?	You play the first 18 turns as normal (18 ship actions + 36 player actions). Currently, the deck will be empty during the player actions on the 18th turn. Then the 19th turn starts and that player does their ship action, they go to event phase and deck is empty, so you read 1. After resolving 1, that player then does their 2 player actions. The 20th turn is when the next event card would be drawn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623766/crew-abilities-abilities-redraw-fate-if-1	Can the non-active player use crew abilities on the crew members he controls to help out the active player?	The non-active player can help out by activating some of their Crew Board abilities, but not others. Only select Crew Board abilities can help other players/crew members; certain Crew Board abilities can only be used to affect that specific crew member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623766/crew-abilities-abilities-redraw-fate-if-1	During the active player's turn, could the non-active player use command-activated effects of ability cards equipped by his crew members?	Yes they can, but it depends on the language of the ability card on whether it can help the other player, or another crew-member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623766/crew-abilities-abilities-redraw-fate-if-1	Can a player use the Redraw Fate if 1 crew ability if he is the non-active player and the active player draws a fate 1 card?	No. 'You' always refers to the player who controls the crew member who has that ability. Also, as a clarification, there are times the non-active player may be able to use this. In Combat, the non-active player is still drawing fate for their attacks, and thus can use this Crew Board ability then to redraw fate on one of their attacks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623692/spoiler-adventure-card-137	The card (Fish Bone Spear) is a weapon. Unlike the other weapon cards, it is not mentioned on it the word 'Weapon'. Probably because it is also a totem. Should I still equip it to a crew member the moment I get it?Thanks.	Yes. There are several totems that are also weapons.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623494/quests-12-and-coins	Aside from the introductory game, i.e. in the future campaigns - are we meant to start the campaign with Quests 1 and 2 as well?	Yes, you should start with them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2620751/rotten-supplies-event-card	Does this ability stack? Every time we cook do we flip 2 fate cards?	Yes, I think you definitely need to do it twice. Otherwise the second card has no effect, in which case why would they have included two of them in the event deck? That’s the way I’ve been playing it, anyway. I can’t see any reason why you *wouldn’t* do it twice.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2619309/redraw-fate-question	Can I use command to redraw fate (on the Gear adventure card for example) on another players skill check / attack? If they were out of command for instance. We have been playing that you can't and I'm not 100%. I guess the same question for a characters (Kasumi's) crew board? Can her re-draw fate ability be used on another players turn?	The rules say you can spend command at any time, even on another player's turn. There are certain exceptions but this is not listed as one as far as I can tell from a quick scan of the spending command section. Command is supposed to represent the crew's mental and physical readiness and their ability to work together so if non-active players have the command to spend then it's fine.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2619010/defense-symbol-on-adventure-cards-question	what does a defense symbol on an adventure card mean? Can I spend that card's command cost when one of my crewmates is being hit to negate that much damage?	Yes. Actually, when anybody's crewmate is being hit I believe. With added benefit of being able to use this block for end of round attacks as well. Normal block found on weapons cannot be used this way.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618969/can-you-discard-an-adventure-card	Can you discard an adventure card?	Yeah I’ve come across a couple of these - once it did say to put the card back, and once it didn’t. I think the lack of instruction to lose that card is probably just an oversight. There's also an adventure card errata that confirms this for the only example of this that I have seen (or seen talked about).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	Can you discard two matching equipped ability cards for two extra damage?	No, you can only discard 1 equipped matching-icon ability card for +1 damage each attack. You can't discard 2 cards for +2 damage via weapon ability, but you can discard them sequentially for +1 damage on two separate attacks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	Does the rulebook allow discarding two cards for two extra damage?	The rulebook (version 3.1) indicates you may discard 1 equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage, suggesting you cannot discard two cards for two extra damage. It seems to be a one-time effect per attack, not a 'per discard' effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2615417/does-an-attack-by-a-crew-member-with-one-fatigue-r	Simply when does that second fatigue token take effect, on the second attack or after the second attack? IOW does the second attack result in a -1 damage or every attack after that second attack?	"Fatigue occurs after the attack is resolved, so unless you have an item/adventure card that removes fatigue, you can get a maximum of 2 attacks with ""fatigue"" weapons...after which, any normal weapon attacks will be at -1 damage because of exhaustion."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2615332/clarification-on-accuracy-crew-ability	when you utilize Laurent's ability to increase his accuracy how long does it last?	Yes, it only lasts for one combat check, and it can only be used when Laurent attacks. You can activate it after drawing fate though... so it's typically emergency use when you need one more point of accuracy to hit.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611685/are-market-cards-treated-as-adventure-cards-in-eve	"Are ""Market Cards"" treated as ""Adventure Cards"" in every way?"	Yes they do count as adventure cards for scoring. You are only competing with yourself, so if you want to pad your score in any legitimate way then go for it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611685/are-market-cards-treated-as-adventure-cards-in-eve	"In calculating the ""Final Score"" is says: Gain 2 points per adventure card. We did not count our plethora of Market Cards in our final score, as they were not labeled as ""Adventure Cards."" Should they count?"	There are 4 starting cards in the market deck. Yes they do count as adventure cards for scoring.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611685/are-market-cards-treated-as-adventure-cards-in-eve	Can buying cheaper Market Cards instead of more expensive ones affect my final score?	Buying cheaper cards does not gain you more points unless they cost 1. If you mean buying cheaper cards rather than better cards, that is up to you. Weapons are expensive, but are totally worth it. More expensive recipes are usually more efficient than the cheaper ones. There are many exceptions, but typically the more expensive market cards provide better use of your command points.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2610851/bandage	How does the bandage ability card work? Do you just use it any time and discard? Or can you use it an unlimited number of times?	"It's an Instant Effect. Rule Book pg. 34, ""General Ability Card Rules"" - Instant Effect: Apply the effect the moment that you equip the ability card. As it doesn't have a cost, I would presume these are one time triggers. After that the card is effectively blank. The special ability is used up, as others posted above, but you still keep it attached for the skill bonus until you discard the card."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609514/event-card-question	When you go through the Event Card deck for the first time, and after taking the step indicated, you replace the Event Card deck, right? When you do that, do you retrieve all the event cards from the box, reshuffle, and pick 6-6-6 per the rules? Or do you use the same 18 cards for the second and third runthroughs?	you construct a new one, from new cards that weren't originally in play	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609072/lose-quest-vs-discard-quest	"I lost a quest. Based on my choices we chose a different path and didn't complete it. I was told ""lose quest XX"". Does this quest go in the discard box or back in the deck of quest cards? If it goes in the discard box, I'll get a point for it at the end of the campaign which seems off, but if I put it back in the deck could I possibly regain that quest?"	When the storybook says “Lose quest x,” or “Complete quest x,” place the specified card in the used quest box. Once quests are in this box, you cannot retrieve them (unless you are reseting the game for a new campaign).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2608452/when-you-cook-a-recipe-ability-card-clarification	"If the active player, who controls said character, pays 1 COMMAND on ""Flapjacks"" (it's a starting card), will I get the bonus included under that power?"	"I think this is clarified in the rulebook that the ""YOU"" is always referring to the active player - so Option #1 is correct, assuming the active player/controller are both you, which sounds like it is based on your wording. If you are playing solo - you are always the owner and active player so you will always get the bonus when cooking a recipe."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2607839/captains-synergy-token	Does the captains synergy token let you place all damage for that attack diagonally or just 1 damage diagonally?	"The way it's written, I would say any/all damage.  It doesn't say a damage, or one damage.  Just damage.""When activated, the crew member may place damage diagonally."" (Rule Book, pg. 25)"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606614/ability-clarifications-not-so-clear	"If Crew Board Ability Rules don't apply to Ability Cards, then can you use cards like ""Treat"" to remove status from other characters?"	"Yes, you can use cards like ""Treat"" to remove status from other characters, as abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606614/ability-clarifications-not-so-clear	Does this mean that cards like Bold Attempt that allow Fate Redraw can only be used when that character it is equipped on draws fate, or can it be used when any character or player draws fate?	Bold Attempt, Discard to redraw fate, can be done for any player's fate draw any time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606175/story-1-first-time-through-event-deck-spoilers	So why do we need to discard our ability cards?	The ability cards represent temporary bonuses gained by training and preparing. They are not long-term skills and are meant to be discarded to allow players to make decisions about what abilities to equip for the entire run of the campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606175/story-1-first-time-through-event-deck-spoilers	Why does our crew get weaker?	The crew gets weaker because the ability cards, which provide temporary bonuses, are discarded after certain events, reflecting the loss of these temporary boosts.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605658/multiple-keywords-for-an-explore	"During an explore action, the excerpt said ""if keyword X turn to entry Y"" AND ""if keyword Z turn to entry V""...we have both keywords...do we get to choose which keyword we want to turn to, or is it first keyword listed takes priority?"	Since you read from top to bottom, I always thought of it as go to the 1st keyword first. Then if you revisit, go to the 2nd keyword. So you're going in order. It makes sense since if you have no keywords, you follow the rest of the entry.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605333/enemy-end-of-round-damage	For the end of round damage, it's the active player that assigns damage and can assign it to any crew member, including other player's crew members - does that sound correct?	This is correct. At the end of round the active player chooses to which crew member, including other player's crew members, will receive the damage.Note that this is different from a counter attack. After a counter attack, the attacking crew member will receive the damage and only if this crew members maxes out on health the active player chooses which other crew member will receive the remaining damage. See page 23 (5).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604720/enemy-cards-clarification	Is it okay to put damage on a totally empty spot (without a caption) or is that against the rules?	It's perfectly ok to put damage on an empty spot. Yes, not just allowed but often necessary.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604443/question-about-dungeons-solo	Added the Dungeons into the mix with my 3rd campaign, like them a lot, just to clarify there are 3 actions:1. Move2. Explore3. CampEach player gets 3 actions, so when playing solo it seems like there is no reason to break it down to 3 actions per round since the rules do not say that the actions have to be different.  Thus just move and explore until the characters need a rest and then camp.Hope I was playing this correctly.	Yeah, I don't think there's any reason to keep track of sets of 3 actions when you're playing solo. It seems like a way to get all players involved during multiplayer so it isn't just the player who took the initial explore action to enter the dungeon making all of the decisions.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2602913/activating-an-adventure-card-when-no-character-par	Say for example I chose not to fatigue a character for a perception skill test of 6 and draw a 5 fate card. Am I allowed to activate an adventure card (like Bigfoot the Dog) to gain that final perception and pass the test?	Yes, absolutely, it's a great way to raise your chances of succeeding without unnecessarily exhausting a character.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601437/a-smattering-of-post-play-questions-search-tokens	Can combat abilities, like +1 accuracy or damage, ONLY be used if the character whose board they're on is the active combat participant, or can you spend command tokens to bolster others?	"Page 34 clarifies this ""Ability Clarifications."" Bonuses to accuracy, block, and damage are only for that crew member. Others can be used on any crew member even if the crew member with the ability is not being used directly."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601294/questions-combat-and-ship-action	Can I run away if I'm doomed?	You can never run away (unless the story book explicitly gives that option somewhere).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601294/questions-combat-and-ship-action	If I choose to, can I cycle between the same 2 ship locations turn after turn (provided, of course, the locations aren't fully damaged)?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	When dealing splash damage, if you do 2 damage to a 2 heart, can you then put 2 damage (across two boxes) to another enemy?	Damage dealt. So yes, you could do 2 damage to a 2 heart (covering only one box), and then put 2 damage (across two boxes) as splash damage to another enemy.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	Overwork ability (once per turn, gain 1 low morale to redraw fate): does the low morale need to go on the crew with the Overwork ability?	No, it can go on any crew member. If you don’t actually gain any Low Morale (because they’re all in play), then you can’t redraw fate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	There’s an ability Power Strike (perception) that is different from Power Strike (strength). For the perception version of the ability, it says you can pay 1 command to get +1 damage when this crew member hits. How does it work?	Since command spent for abilities goes back to the supply, you can use this multiple times in the same combat if that crew member hits a monster multiple times, assuming you have enough command to spend. But, you can still only spend one command per hit (and only if you hit).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	The Refine ability lets me spend 1 command to repair the ship. Since I don’t put spent command on ability cards, I can always repair the ship as much as I want, at any time, as long as I have 1 command to spend. Is that right?	Right. There are intentionally several ways for players to repair ship damage. Remember you must discard all your played ability cards each time through the event deck.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598795/what-rooms-for-ship-damage	What rooms for ship damage?	When instructed to take ship damage, draw 1 ability card per damage, then place a cube on the room(s) with a matching fate number. Each ship room can only take 2 damage and the hull can take 1 damage. If a room already has 2 damage, you may choose where to place the damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598795/what-rooms-for-ship-damage	When you spend command to activate an ability card, where does that token go?	When you spend command to activate an ability card, that token does not go on the card but directly back to the supply. That means that as long as that character's player has command points, they can keep activating that card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598795/what-rooms-for-ship-damage	How is ship damage determined?	When Manticore takes damage, you draw a fate card to determine location for each point of damage, not each instance of damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598070/refine-ability-card	The Refine ability let’s you spend a command to repair a ship damage. Can you do this as many times as you want? Or once per turn? Or does the command go on the ability card and then get cleared similar to adventure cards?	Spending command on ability cards goes back to the supply, so as long as you have command you want to waste (er, spend), go crazy nuts, in my opinion...	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598070/refine-ability-card	It appears there are other ability cards that have spend command as well, so the general question is how exactly this works.	Spending command on ability cards goes back to the supply, so as long as you have command you want to waste (er, spend), go crazy nuts, in my opinion... For Refine, that’s really powerful! Repair a ship damage for each command. That means if you go to the Quarters in a four player game you can repair half the ship (5 damage) if desired.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598044/does-venom-damage-redistribute	Does Venom Damage Redistribute	No, in this case, if a crew member with venom has 0 health, ignore the effects of the venom token.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598044/does-venom-damage-redistribute	If crew member has zero health and poisoned, will the poison go away or does it stay.?	It stays until you remove it with an ability.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597986/gregory-synergy-token-question	If a character with Gregory's synergy token takes more damage than they have remaining health, does the excess damage go elsewhere and then you heal two, or do you heal two and then excess damage continues going on that character?  Thanks!	You hit zero and the rest of the damage goes away is distributed amongst other crew. Then you heal to 2.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597649/combat-damage-stacking	When an enemy has a double or triple heart, do you need to do 2 damage in one hit to cover it or can you place one damage and have another player place the 2nd damage on their turn?	You need the exact damage. 3 heart requires 3 damage on a single hit.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597649/combat-damage-stacking	If there is a damage token in the middle of the enemy card and I wanted to place 3 damage...can I place damage to the right and left of the middle square and then one damage is nullified because of the middle square already containing damage?	You cannot cover damage that has already been covered. You have to go around it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597446/combat-clarifications	Can I put a damage token on an empty space?	Yes, you can place on empty spaces, this can be beneficial when trying to get damage from one side of the enemy's hit boxes to the other. (see Marco's synergy token for ideas on doing this efficiently)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597446/combat-clarifications	When placing splash damage, must it be adjacent to damage places on the target?	Yes, damage adjacency must be preserved across the border between the cards. What you describe is accurate, only thing to add is that at least half of all damage done must be done to your initial target (namely the one you chose to attack first and meet its defense number) not necessarily where the 'first' damage goes. For example, dealing 3 damage to your enemies, 2 of the damage must be done to your initial target and 1 damage can splash to adjacent. This is a good way to get damage onto an enemy that has a high defense rating.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597408/equipping-an-ability-card-to-crew-members-which-on	Equipping An Ability Card To Crew Members - Which Ones?	Ability cards can be played to any crew member. It was confirmed elsewhere.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597321/challenge-discard-ability-card-require-participati	Must a crew member be assigned to a challenge to allow a player to discard a card to add skill to the total fate draw?	Any player (human) may discard an ability card from hand to add skill to the total fate draw, whether or not the player had any crew members participate in the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597180/status	When card such as “vegetable pie” says remove status, does that mean one status or all status or one status on all or all status on one crew member?	One status on one crew member. If it is more than one status and/or effects more than one crew member it specifies that.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596754/going-through-the-event-deck	After going through the event deck once (and reading the story), do you go through the same stack of events for the 2nd and 3rd times, or use 18 new events for each time through?	Somewhere in the rule book it says you return the used event cards into the box and start with a new set for each round.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596609/map-challenges-ie-storms-etc	We ran across the thunderstorm on the first map, and we're not sure exactly how we go about challenging it. Does the player whose turn it is activate a person for the challenge? Can you just draw a fate card, and use that number for the challenge, without using a person?	Yes, you don't need to allocate a character to challenges. You can just draw a card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2595755/campaign-end-trigger	what actually triggers the end of a campaign?	The campaign usually ends when you've run through the event deck three times.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594416/adjacent-regen-question	If an enemy has the “adjacent regen” power, does that regenerate one health on each adjacent monster (on both sides) for each box that has that keyword? Or does the box on the left only regenerate the enemy on the left, and the box on the right only regenerate the enemy on the right?	Adjacent Regen 1:This activates at the end of each combat round. Remove 1 damage token from each enemy card that is directly adjacent to this enemy card (the active player chooses which) To me that means for each ability printed on the card you do it once, so 2 printed Adjacent Regen, you do the ability twice per end of the combat round unless the ability is covered of course.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594416/adjacent-regen-question	"If a monster gets killed, but adjacent monster triggers the ""Regenerate adjacent"" ability, does it revive the killed monster? Does the revived monster also deal damage to the player characters?"	"A defeated enemy should be immediately removed from the array, and any remaining enemy cards should be moved closer together to get rid of the gap (if one was left). Because of this, it's not possible for a defeated enemy to still be ""adjacent"" to any of the other enemies."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594410/combat-question-enemy-order	Can’t find this in the rulebook or BGG. When setting up combat, are you free to line up the enemies in any order, or do they have to go in the order listed in the story book?	When you pull out the specific enemy cards for an encounter, you shuffle them and then lay them out according to the shuffled order. So it's randomized. You should be able to find this rule on page 21 of the rulebook or thereabouts	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594336/rule-questions	When an enemy makes its counter attack and does damage to the character that attacked the enemy, if there is extra damage does the active player choose one of their other characters to take the rest of the damage? If so, can the other character use their block to reduce some of that damage.	Yes, another character takes the remainder of the damage (doesn’t have to be yours). No, their block isn’t used.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594336/rule-questions	When you heal players back up that only removes damage and not fatigue or status effects? For example if you were defeated from all players losing all of their health you need to heal everyone back to full health and remove all fatigue markers, but do you remove status effects?	Only if it tells you to.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594099/visiting-a-port-action-clarification	When visiting a Port as an Action, you can visit the Inn, pay 4 coins and “each crew member restores 2 health and removes 1 fatigue”. Is this limited to the active player’s crew members, or do all 9 crew receive the benefit?	All 9 receive the benefit, and you can use the sickbay to heal other player’s characters.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594099/visiting-a-port-action-clarification	Can you choose to just flip a card and not add your accuracy bonus like you do in challenges?	For a challenge you're choosing which/how many character to use, so you can just choose not to use any characters and flip a fate anyway. For a combat action, you have to choose one specific character and weapon to use, so you do have to both add your accuracy and add fate. You can't make an attack without using a character, so you can't leave your accuracy bonus out.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2571050/achievements-and-unlocked-cards-no-spoiler	Just wanted to clarify: I add the total number of Totems found and Endings achieved to reach a figure (for example 11). Then do I get all of the unlocked quest cards that correspond to the checked boxes up to and including 11? So if I reached eleven, would I get Quest cards 171-172, 169-170, 168 and 174? Or only 174?	Pretty sure you get all of them. The rules say you can choose to start with fewer Quests if you want to, for whatever reason.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2570282/instant-effect-rules-check	I assume an instant effect on an ability card like the healing from a bandage is immediate on equipping it to the character only and cannot be used again.Am I right?	Yes thats correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2566166/synergy-tokens	Can a crew member have multiple synergy tokens on their crew board?	Yes, a crew member can have multiple synergy tokens, and they can even use them together on the same attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	When moving the ship and entering a space showing a hazard (skill test) in the first space you move to, can you still move to a second space afterwards?	Yes you can continue to move. You just have to apply the negative effect if you failed the challenge but can still continue onward.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	After having placed command tokens on a crew board to do the top ability, can you still do the bottom ability later, or do you need to remove all command first?	No. You can only use one command ability on a crew board and then need to remove all command before activating another crew board command ability.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	Any player can discard a card from their hand to give +1 of the corresponding skill during a challenge, even if it's not that player's turn and even if his characters are not involved in the challenge?	Correct. Any player can discard any number of ability cards with the corresponding icon to help. They do not need to be involved in the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	If you attack 2 enemies with a single attack (placing connecting cubes on the squares of 2 enemy cards), only the one you hit first will counterattack you immediately afterwards (provided that it didn't die)?	Correct. You only get counterattacked by the enemy you targeted. Just making sure that if you're placing more than 2 cubes, the majority have to be placed on the enemy you are targeting.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	How and when does the game give command tokens to players?	You normally start the campaign with 1 command token per player, but every ship action location will give you some tokens. The only time you won't get any tokens is when there are none left in the bank.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	Do credits from previous achievements carry over in subsequent campaigns?	Credits from previous achievements do not carry over but functionally are locked out: you are expected to avoid previously obtained totems.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565586/numbers-on-hearts	What are the numbers on some of the heart-symbols on enemycards are for?	Numbers in hearts is the amount of damage required to put 1 damage token in that space. Numbers in flames is amount of damage added to monster attack if left uncovered. The flame symbols only need 1 damage token to cover them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2563480/blocking-leftover-damage-from-a-counterattack	Let's say a counterattack (not end of round attack) reduces a character to 0 health, but there is still leftover damage to assign. If I assign that damage to a character with access to block greater than 0, can I use that block to reduce the damage taken by this character at this point?	No, you only apply the block from the weapon you used in the same attack. So you would need to apply the leftover damage in full.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2563470/synergy-token-when-reduced-to-0-health	Let's say for example Rafael has a synergy token on Sofi's board.If Rafael is then reduced to 0 health, does his synergy token remain available to use on Sofi's board? Or is it removed from play?	Even if Rafael is reduced to 0 health, you can still use his synergy token on Sofi's board.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2562724/defeat-due-to-all-crew-at-0-health	The rules for defeat only say to remove all crew damage and fatigue. Does this mean in normal mode I am meant to leave status tokens and command tokens in place when I resume?	Yes, keep fatigue and status tokens when you resume. Edit- Keep status and command on crew members after defeat, not fatigue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2561673/weapons	If player 1 purchases a weapon from the market, can player 2 equip the weapon onto one of their crew instead?	Yes, any player can equip the weapon. Players decide together who gets each weapon (in the case of a dispute, the Captain player decides).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2561673/weapons	If one of the crew from player 1 has a weapon, can they just pass that weapon onto another crew member or other player's crew member at no extra cost (i.e., spending command) or is that just not allowed at all once equipped?	Yes, you can pass weapons to other crew members at any time except during combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2561673/weapons	Can players swap crew members during their turn between players?	No, players cannot swap crew members between turns.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2543117/primeval-peril-rules-for-multiplayer	What are the differences in playing with two players?	- In CHALLENGES you can only use your crew members (and the captain); other crew members may be used, if the player spends one command - In COMBAT every player has to use Combat action tokens only on his own crew members (and the captain if active player); but you can pass them around for one command - You have more ability cards in hand (because every player is allowed to have up to 3 cards) - I think you can only spend command tokens for your own crew members...And that's it, isn't it? Because you gain a bit more command in two player games, its basically the same, isn't it?	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2543117/primeval-peril-rules-for-multiplayer	All spend command tokens go directly back to supply except for crew abilities and adventure cards, correct?	This is all correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542651/adventure-cards-and-combat	In Peril, can a single character fight with more than one weapon or add cards from hand during combat?	Adventure cards that are 'Weapons' have to be equipped to individual crew members outside of combat, and you have to choose before attacking to use an equipped weapon or the crew member's default, so they cannot be used by multiple crew members during combat. You cannot add cards from hand during combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542651/adventure-cards-and-combat	Are Adventure cards shared by all characters in Peril?	Other adventure cards like 'Equipment' are placed in the middle for use by anyone. Weapons, however, have to be equipped to individual crew members and cannot be shared during combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542651/adventure-cards-and-combat	In combat, can every character use the same weapon?	No, weapons have to be equipped to individual crew members outside of combat and cannot be used by multiple crew members during combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542651/adventure-cards-and-combat	Is Fatigue added to any character that does a challenge, but not combat?	Yes, fatigue is only added for challenges, but if a crew member is tired (2 tokens) they get -1 damage in combat (and cannot take part in challenges).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542447/combat-damage-after-missing	If I miss and then take the counterattack damage I am still able to do 1 damage correct?	Yes, you do 1 damage after the counterattack if you missed (and still have health).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537285/primeval-peril-discarding-ability-cards-wording	"If a card just says ""discard this card to..."" rather than ""discard this equipped card to..."" can it simple be discarded from your hand directly to trigger the effect?"	You're right, it should specify the equipped card but, you also must equipped an ability card to gain the ability hence if you don't have it equipped the ability text takes no effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537280/command-tokens-and-crew-board-abilities	When using the bridge action from the ship board do you have to remove all command tokens from all character boards, ability and adventure cards? or can you decide which to leave.	Yes, all command tokens should be returned to the supply.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537003/travel-and-hazard	Hello.If there is a Hazard in the first space I enter, can I travel more than 1 space after I resolve the challenge, no matter if I win or lose it ?	I reckon you can, rules don't say anything about this, the only thing is that if you enter a hazard space you must complete the hazard’s challenge or take negative consequences (and you always draw fate even if you decide not to fatigue anybody), after that you can take the remaining movement.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535700/weakened-status	Is this errata from where the  crew members have multiple skill points? And if not, how does it works?	If your crew member has 3 Cunning but is weakened, they now only have 1 Cunning. Same for the other skills.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535700/weakened-status	What if I have no equipped strength ability card ? Is my total -1 ?	Technically yes, but you can't go below 0, so your total is 0.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535437/primeval-peril-venom-in-combat	If I get a venom token in a combat, do this crew member lose 1 health in the next combat round or in the next turn. Or more exactly, is a next combat round also a next turn?	Venom causes the crew member to lose 1 health at the start of each game turn (not in each combat round). For example, you end combat, complete your exploration action, and the turn ends. The next game turn starts, Jon has a venom token, so he loses 1 health. You then take your ship action, complete an event, etc.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535437/primeval-peril-venom-in-combat	Even if I control that character he loses 1 health in other players turns, right?	Correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535322/primeval-pwhat-does-remove-1-fatigue-mean	What does remove 1 fatigue mean?	If you gain a 2nd fatigue, the character should have a total of 2 tokens. The second token is placed showing the side with the “2 tokens: -1 damage” face up to remind you that if you have two tokens, you deal -1 damage.So the Aft Deck action just lets you remove one token.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533113/block-and-weapons	Do you add all block values for a total Block of 3? Or do you only use the block of the equipped weapon for a total of 1?	You only apply block (the blue circle icon) with the weapon you use to attack, not all of the weapons you have equipped. And it only applies during the enemy counter attack (not the end-of-round enemy attacks).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533113/block-and-weapons	I’m still not clear on the end of round attack. So you can’t block that at all?	Only by using specific adventure cards or using other special abilities. Weapon block doesn't count for end of round attacks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532545/primevil-peril-game-end	Is finding Shen the game end condition?	There is indeed a story end you've not found yet! The storybook will tell you when you have a game over. You need to escape, still!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Does the weakened effect happen to all characters or just one?	Just 1 character gains a weakened token unless otherwise stated.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Should a fate card  always be drawn for every challenge?	Yes, you should draw fate for every challenge, even if there is small or no chance that you'll complete it successfully.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Just to clarify, if the Captain has 2 Strength (including equipped abilities), I only get the +2 Strength if I put a fatigue on the Captain. But, if the Captain has the equipped ability Bold Attempt (discard to redraw fate), I could still use the ability even if the Captain did not spend fatigue to participate in the challenge, right? Also, if I did spend fatigue and the Captain gave +2 Strength, and then I discarded Bold Attempt to redraw fate, then now the Captain only contributes +1 Strength, right?	Still count the strength since the draw comes after having already decided to use the crew member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	 If I decide to don‘t use a crew member in a challenge, I draw a fate. Can I decide after the fate to use a crew member?	No, you cannot decide to use a crew member after the fate draw. You can, however, activate adventure cards or discard ability cards from hand to alter the final result.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	If no crew member was chosen to fatigue and the challenge is failed, how is it determined which crew member suffers the consequences?	Anyone who participated takes consequences first, otherwise you choose who takes the consequences. You can split up damage between crew members how you like.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	Just starting a new campaign for the first time. If no one is assigned, then who loses health?	If the result just says '-1 health' and no specific crew member is assigned, it is assumed that you can assign the health loss to whomever you want.
