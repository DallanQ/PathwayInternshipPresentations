https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3271748/i-have-2-questions-about-combat-one-is-about-allow	Can you place 4 damage in a square shaped pattern? Or would one of these placements be diagonally and not allowed?	4 damage in a square is ok. Place the first one top left, then top right, then bottom right, then bottom left.	
	Can you do partial damage to an enemy heart symbol of more than value 1, or is all or nothing?	It's all or nothing.	
	Square is ok because one damage is placed next to previous and not diagonally, but now I wonder if 4 damage could be placed as a T shape? After all every damage is next to another but definitely not from previous...	A T is allowed. Its even used as a specific example in the rules.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3269600/travel-to-new-page-with-movement-left	When travelling to new page, does movement stop automatically on the new page or can I continue to move if I have more movement left?	You can continue moving.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3266861/audries-power-block	But why does it say that "Audrie's 2nd crew board ability gives +1 block"?	Some of the crew abilities can be used in combat. Audrie's second now gets an additional +1 block so you can use it in combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3260955/when-does-the-fight-start	When does the fight start?	You can do it up until you look at the enemy card. Once you look at the enemy card, you may no longer eat food.  So when you see the word "fight", it doesn't matter.  Did you look at the enemy card?  If "yes", then combat has began and you may not eat. If "no" then you still may eat, even if you know that you are about to begin a fight.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3254605/discard-activity-cards	Can you discard cards during any challenge to increase your success?	Yes, any player may discard any number of ability cards from their hands to add the associated skill to the challenge. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3253107/zombie-merchant-event	So assuming I have $5, I can purchase all 15 food tokens? This seems absurdly powerful, no matter the 50% chance of gaining weakened. Am I misreading this card?	Your interpretation sounds right to me, especially given the opening qualifier "you may purchase any number...." I also agree that it does seem absurdly overpowered. Hoping I do come across it now!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3250276/when-doing-a-challenge-can-i-not-use-a-crew-member	When doing a challenge, can I not use a crew member?	You can choose to have no crew members participate and simply move on to the draw fate step.	
	 Can anyone share the damage incurred in case of failure?	−X health: You must take crew damage. Damage must be applied to any crew members that participated first.	
	And when I do a challenge using a crew member, if I fail, do I have to take all the damage to that crew member?	Since no crew participated, damage goes to whoever you want.	
	Do you give all the damage to one designated crew member and move on to the next crew member, or do you split the damage up little by little?	Damage must be applied to any crew members that participated first. Since no crew participated, damage goes to whoever you want.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248892/when-i-do-an-ability-test-can-i-look-at-the-cards	When I do an ability test, can I look at the cards already used in advance, calculate the success probability more, and then draw the ability cards?	Yes, equipped and discarded ability cards are public so you can calculate the odds.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248889/when-my-crew-completes-4-attacks-and-the-enemy-att	When my crew completes 4 attacks and the enemy attacks, can I distribute the damage and status ailments to any crew member? Or will I get to split it among the crew members who participated in the battle this round?	It's not a counterattack, so my understanding is that it can be against any of the 9 members, regardless of whether they acted or not. But the attack is against one character, not to be divided unless they are knocked out and there is still damage left to allocate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248851/you-spent-one-of-two-action-actions-to-explore-the	You spent one of two action actions to explore the port and progress through the story related to it. And do I have to spend one more action to take a port-related action (such as resting) at that port?	Taking an Explore action and taking a Port action are both separate actions so doing both would be all you could do on a turn. If you already spent two actions, then you'll have to wait until next turn to take a Port action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248842/do-crew-members-who-attack-using-combat-markers-in	Do crew members who attack using combat markers in battle get fatigue tokens?	No.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248832/if-the-enemy-counterattacks-after-failing-to-attac	If the enemy counterattacks after failing to attack, you can deal 1 damage to the enemy again. Even if the attack is successful, will the enemy counterattack and then deal 1 damage to the enemy again?	If the attack is successful, then you don't deal an additional damage. The additional damage is only if you miss on your attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248829/keywords-are-needed-when-searching-is-it-okay-to-r	Keywords are needed when searching. Is it okay to record the keywords needed for that area in the navigation log?	I'd say definitely. Record everything - you won't regret it, particularly in future campaigns	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248418/if-i-equip-a-weapon-to-my-crew-can-i-equip-other-c	If I equip a weapon to my crew, can I equip other crew members with that weapon whenever I want?	according to rulebook p.29 - not in combat"You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only the weapon info is showing"I think that same rule also apply to totem weapons. believe you can switch which character is using a weapon at any time outside of combat. Once combat begins, you cannot make any changes.	"You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only theweapon info is showing."
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3244949/is-use-of-totem-cards-an-action-spoiler	Is use of Totem cards an action?	It is not an action. But it could only be taken inside a travel action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3230374/combat-with-no-healthy-characters	Halfway through a combat one player had both of their characters go to zero health. What happens when we start a new combat round? Do their combat tokens just get wasted?	In that case the combat token is wasted unfortunately.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3223758/some-questions-about-the-game-rules	Command tokens can be spent to use an equipped ability card. But that only makes sense if the team member has at least one life point left, right?	If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health.	
 	Combat round end ability on level card: 1 defense. Does this apply to the team or only to this team member? And only if this team member has been damaged?	This card is specifically about the damage that enemies do at the end of a full combat round (so after all 4 combat token have been used, see step #2 in the Combat rulepop). If you assign some (or all) of this damage to the crewmember with that specific ability card, then that crewmember receives 1 less damage.	
	Does each wing symbol on an enemy card prevent a hit if no ranged weapon is used? Or is the number of wings irrelevant?	1. The number is irrelevant 2. Wings do not prevent a hit; it makes enemies more difficult to hit: "Enemies with a wing symbol have the flying ability, which means they have +1 defense against any weapons that do not have the “ranged” attribute:". So an enemy with Defense 5 and one or more Wings would have Defense 6 against weapons without the 'Ranged' keyword.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3222657/ship-action-can-i-gain-command-points-cp-then-imme	Ship Action: Can I gain command points (CP) then immediately spend them before removing them? i.e. Quarters > Gain 3 CP (solo play) > immediately spend CP on adventure cards > Remove CP from the cards	The rulebook says "Ship action effects can be applied in any order." and "You may spend command at any time, even on other players’ turns (with some exceptions, as explained below).".The exceptions don't mention the ship action; so yes, you can.	"Ship action effects can be applied in any order." and "You may spend command at any time, even on other players’ turns (with some exceptions, as explained below).".The exceptions don't mention the ship action.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3221166/level-cards-artifacts-and-more	Can a crew member equip multiple Level Cards?	Yes, the level cards (brown bottom) can be multiple and stay with the crew member even after the Event Deck reset when you have to discard the equipped Ability Cards (blue bottom) back into the Fate Deck.	
	Can I use Artifacts as coins?	Yes, artefacts can be used as coins.	
	Can I use my crew member abilities during combat turn of another player? Or generally during a turn of another player?	You can use your crew member abilities in another player's turn. Adventure cards can also be used in somebody else’s turn by just paying their cost.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3210769/adventure-card-command-tokens	  Is the player able to keep activating the same adventure card if there is already command token on it, by placing more command tokens each time?	Once a card has command on it, the command token(s) must be removed before it can be used again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3208566/few-more-questions	If an ability card requires an activation token to use (say to give +1 damage), I'm assuming it can be activated as many times as you have command tokens, as each token to activate ability card goes back to supply right?	Yes.	
	Can a person without a ranged weapon that does a damage of 1, still destroy the wings of a flying enemy? Or does it just void the entire attack?	Yes. The “Flying” enemy ability just makes it more difficult to hit if you don’t have a ranged weapon. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#enemies	
	For the level up cards that trigger when certain things happen (use the bridge, explore, etc), do they trigger when any player does this, or only the player who controls the crewmember? For example if player 1 controls Laurent and Laurent has the level card that grants a command when using the bridge, what if player 2 visits the bridge?	Rules for Ability Cards generally apply to Level Cards also. Essentially a level card is a special type of ability card. So, “Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.” https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#ability-cards	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3206341/where-does-the-captain-go	Where does the captain go?	The active player is always the captain.There is a "Captain" marker that the active player can have each turn to help everyone remember who is the actual captain for the turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3205199/are-the-rings-considered-a-line	Are the rings considered a line?	Assuming you mean the ring binder of the map book, then yes that is a border. Quote from the sleeping gods rulepop"Regions are separated by dotted lines, land, the spiral binding of the atlas, and the edge of the page. The ship cannot reside on or move through land, only sea regions."	"Regions are separated by dotted lines, land, the spiral binding of the atlas, and the edge of the page. The ship cannot reside on or move through land, only sea regions."
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3201053/losing-during-a-battle	If, during a battle, I manage to slay some of the enemies but then I lose, if I will go back to that battle in the future, does it mean that the enemies I have killed don’t take part in the battle anymore, or are they revived and I have to kill them one more time?	You set up the battle from scratch and fight all enemies again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3200835/owning-quest-cards	How One is owning quest cards? If i complete or lose quests do I loose the keyword?	Yes, you would lose the given keyword in those cases. The keyword is active as long as the according quest card is active.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3198679/some-simple-questions-after-first-session	When we lose a challenge, who gets the damage?	Damage and Status effects are applied to those crew members who took part in the challenge before non-participating members.	
	The manual tells me, that first the participating team members get damage. So, when do non-participants get damage?	If all participating crewmembers are knocked out, then any remaining damage must be allocated to non-participating crew.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3198603/failure-of-combat	So what happens if we fail combat and everyone dies?	Everything auto-failed. And yes, you can go back and explore again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	can someone have more than one level card or just one per character (so if already had one they would discard it to replace with new one)	why not ?	
	an ability card can be equipped at any time except middle of combat or challenge. So does that imply that the combat or challenge process has started and then can’t be equipped? Or if we say see that we're fighting a particular monster or challenge, but before we actually begin the process of assigning characters or drawing fate etc, we can still equip ability card.	BEFORE you know what the challenge or the combat will be you can not add a savvy card for this savvy challenge...	
	when using command, if my partner has a character who’s attacking, can I spend command on my characters boards to help benefit him? Like I can spend say two command to give their character +1 accuracy or extra damage? And same thing using adventure cards (if I have more command than them I can say pay a command to do a card that will benefit them)?	you need command to add on or more of your character to a challenge but not for fighting anyone can use adventure card or crew ability AFTER drawing the fate (challenge or combat)	
	when discarding an equipped ability for +1 in combat, there was an ability strength card that had as text when discard for combat add 1 damage. Would this be in addition to the modifier on player board? So Raphael discards strength ability for +1 normally. In this situation would it have given 2 (1 for discard and 1 from card text)?	yes 1+1	
	what if in 5) card was different, giving some passive effect. Would that effect still work for this one attack when discarding this card?	yes 1+1	
	The german rules after finishing the event deck say: "after drawing the last card of the event deck, the active player ends his turn." That would mean he skips the action phase completely. Is this true or is it an errata?	This is correct. The special end-of-act event replaces the Event phase of the next player's turn (so no event card is drawn, you read the indicated passage in the book instead).	
	Did you use defense on the characters that took part in combat?	On 4) --> Exactly your first sentence. If a character is chosen as target for the monster's "end of turn" attack, he can still use its weapon defense value. (according to the rule book it would not be allowed. Weapons defense value should only be used against counterattacks)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3183513/event-deck-and-discard-pile-reset	What happens to the event discard pile at the end of the first age?	When you create a new event deck, the original discarded one is removed from the game and the cards are not used again.	
	What happens to any 'ongoing' events at the end of the first age?	Ongoing effects remain until the card conditions are met, or the storybook tells you otherwise.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3180845/event-card-deck	What six cards am I supposed to discard? 	You build the deck according to the instructions and discard the top 6 cards.  Discarding 6 cards is what happens when you DIE.If you didn't die then you don't discard the cards. Or when your ship has FULL Damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	Final scoring, which cards?	Seems that Market cards (including starting Gloria etc.) are COUNTED for final scoring. Adventure cards are also gained through scenario book and are worth 2 points. Some of Adventure cards are Totems. Those are worth 4 points	
	If you fail the cunning challenge, what happens?	If you fail the cunning challenge, you can fight or return to the ship (160.12).	
	Can you do the challenge without choosing any crew member to participate in it?	You can do the challenge even without choosing any crew member to participe in it ; so you would have had to try the challenge again and automatically lose it, which would have make you lose more health. When you fail a challenge and lose health but no crew member was participating, you chose how you want to dispatch the damages between your crew members, so the two remaining would have also died at some point	
	What happens if no crew member participates in the challenge?	If no crew member participates in the challenge, you only look at the fate number on the card but don't apply any bonus you would have gained from a crew member	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3160548/challenge-phase-can-a-non-active-player-who-doesn	Challenge phase -  can a non active player (who doesn’t acquire a fatigue token) play use his/her equipped card ability?	No, only active characters. It's not stated directly, but is implied in the challenge example: > Determine the sum of the specified skills on participating crew members (which is usually 1 per crew member plus any relevant equipped ability cards they have) and move to the next step.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3157128/how-to-deal-with-results-of-a-challenge-if-no-char	How to deal with results of a challenge if no character assigned	If no crew are assigned to a challenge or travel, you can spread any damage and effects among the crew any way you wish.	
	If you're referring to the hearts in the grid with a number in it, what does that mean?	That means that you have to inflict X damage in order to cover it. You just place 1 damage token, not subtract X damage from your total damage value (which means even with Y damage, where Y>X, you're not placing Y damage tokens, for example if you make 3 damage, but use 2 of that to cover up a heart with a 2, you're only placing one more damage token).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3147190/sleeping-gods-starting-over-second-campaign	should I also put back the completed missions?	The used quests and adventure cards go back in their respective decks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3143866/card-stone-of-blood	According to the rules of the game, a command token may be spent at any time. This should also apply to the time of the combat, right?	You are correct. Adventure cards can be triggered outside of a character strike/attack.	
	Would it then be allowed to activate the adventure card "Stone of Blood" immediately before the outbreak of combat in order to cover a field on an opponent card?	You are correct. Adventure cards can be triggered outside of a character strike/attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3135448/when-giving-unused-combat-action-tokens-who-gets-t	When giving unused combat action tokens, who gets the token back at the start of the next round?	Just for the round. Next round, each player gets their combat markers back.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3129703/exhausted-event-decks-after-era-1-what-happens-aft	Exhausted event decks after “era 1”, what happens after?	You don't re-shuffle events, you take new ones. Events you already saw should be discarded and not come back.	
	Should you write down keywords even if it doesn't make thematic sense?	It depends on the player's preference. Some players choose not to write down keywords if it doesn't make thematic sense to them, preferring to keep the gameplay more in line with the story's logic. Others write them down regardless, focusing on the gameplay mechanic rather than the thematic aspect. It's a matter of personal choice and how it affects your enjoyment of the game.	
	Is it normal in video games to find something that needs a specific item or keyword to progress?	Yes, it is a normal part of the design in many video games. Players often need to find a specific item or keyword to progress, which is a common gameplay mechanic.	
	For the IRON example, is the door made of iron or is it the key?	In the IRON example, the door is made of iron, not the key. It is thematically sensible to remember an iron door in the back of a cave, as it is unusual and memorable.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3108633/does-synergy-carry-over-between-combat	Does synergy carry over between combat?	No it is specific to that combat.  "At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member’s synergy token is on the matching crew board."https://sleeping-gods.rulepop.com/#synergy	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3101836/both-crew-members-dead	What happens when it comes to your turn but all the crew members you are controlling are defeated?  Do you take your turn like normal and then just have no crew members available to handle anything that comes up?	Yeah, you still take your turn. Other players can still contribute to challenges by paying command.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3098780/frightened-to-0-health-character	Frightened to 0-health character?	Yes you can. Only restriction for applying statuses is they can't go on someone with that state already. Or if it is a story effect that specifies a named character...then it must be applied to that character. But even then, if that named character already has that effect, then nothing happens (no one else takes the effect). There is nothing against this in the rules, so it should be fine.	
	Characters with 0 health & synergy?	From the rulepop FAQ:https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#faq  > Let’s say for example Rafael has a synergy token on Sofi’s board. If Rafael is then reduced to 0 health, does his synergy token remain available to use on Sofi’s board?Even if Rafael is reduced to 0 health, you can still use his synergy token on Sofi’s board. Thematically, when a character reaches 0 health, it means that they’re just really hurt (instead of knocked out or dead).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3088398/when-you-go-through-the-event-deck-the-firstsecond	When you go through the event deck the first/second time...?	You complete your turn after drawing the last event and before reading entry 1/1.2:"After you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player’s turn. On the next turn, read paragraph 1 in the storybook instead of drawing an event card."	
	Is this how you play it out? My scenario: Player A starts their turn. They take a ship action, they draw the last event card and resolve it, they take their two actions (Travel, Explore, Port, Market). Player B starts their turn. They take a ship action, they read/resolve story 1 (since there are no event cards here), they take their two actions	Yes, that's correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3085762/any-crew-member-clarification	For the Galley Ship action, it states :"you may discard exactly 1 ability card from your hand to remove 1 fatigue from any crew member".Does "any crew member" includes crew members controlled by other players ?	Yes it does.Your crew members are referred to as "your" crew members.And "you" refers to yourself as a player.https://sleeping-gods.rulepop.com/#what-players-share	
	Which crew board abilities can help in challenges?	Only +1 to Fate (Mac) and redraw Fate if 1 (Kasumi).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3083930/equipped-ability-cards-using-matching-symbols-to-a	After the ability card is drawn to determine fate for a CHALLENGE can any crew member, including those that have not participated in the challenge originally, spend a command token on an equipped ability card to boost the fate number by 1 if the symbol matches the challenge type?	Treat the symbols on any cards equipped to characters as if they were printed on the character board... they increase that characters stats. There is no need to spend command to activate those symbols.	
	Do symbols on equipped ability cards automatically get added to the fate count or must they spend a command token on the equipped ability card/discarded to the supply to add them?	Symbols on equipped ability cards automatically get added to the fate count. There is no need to spend command tokens.	
	If no participating crew have an ability card with cunning can a non participating crew member spend 1 command on an equipped ability card to boost the fate draw by 1?	Any card symbols on crew NOT participating will have no effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3081668/can-i-still-use-a-weapon-if-it-makes-me-gain-a-sta	Can I still use a weapon if it makes me gain a status effect I already have?	I think you should be able to continue to use it. In challenges and combat monster attacks, status effects must be distributed to another character that doesn't have that status effect yet, but the rules are different when an effect names a specific character.  In those cases, if the specified character already has the status to be applied, the effect to apply the status is simply ignored, with the rest of the result taking effect normally.  This is the one scenario where you would not instead choose a different character to receive that effect.  In this case, I see the weapon's effect to be the same thing. While it isn't identifying a specific character by name, it is stating "this crew member", meaning the character that used the weapon to attack.  So I would say that the crew member must take the low morale if they don't already have it, but if they do, you simply ignore the application of that effect and may use the rest of the card normally. It would not prevent you from using the weapon. You just are always sad while using it :-).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Ship Actions - can ship actions be activated in any order (e.g. draw card, retrieve tokens, get tokens).	Yes Ship Actions can be applied in any order (Rulepop).	
	Travel - can you travel using a crew member of another player?	Since travel is a CRAFT Challenge (but with a maximum of one crew member committed), I assume another player can pay a Command to use one of their crew members.	
	Can another player discard Craft Ability Cards from their hand to boost the total?	Since travel is a CRAFT Challenge I assume another player can discard Abilities cards to boost the total.	
	Can you activate abilities on other player's Crew or Crew Ability Cards?	Check out the clarification for usage of the word "You" on Ability Cards. I think this would apply to Crew Abilities also. So, No — you can only activate abilities for crew members you control.	
	So during combat, when I use a Combat Token, it's effectively my turn, and we can't use any abilities on another player's Crew? And other players couldn't spend a Command to do so (like they can with Challenges)?	Command can be spent at any time, even on another player's turn. So, to help each other during combat you could: * Activate a crew ability or ability card ability that can affect another crew member, like Mac's +1 to a Fate Draw (though there aren't a lot of these) * Equip an ability card from your hand to any crew member. * Activate an Adventure Card * Give or receive a combat action token (so that a crew member could attack twice) I hope that's helpful.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3079310/combat-question-dmg-token-placement	In general, do I have to place tokens adjacent to the last one placed (1-2, 2-3 etc.) OR can I place tokens as long as they are adjacent to ANY one token placed this attack (first, second, third, fourth etc.)?	You must place them one after another, in a row. So 3 adjacent to 2, 4 adjacent to 3 and so on so forth if you have more.	
	Can the non-active player use abilities (both on crew board and equipped ability cards) when it's not their turn (separate from using crew skill icons for a challenge by spending a command point). If so, is there any restrictions on this? During combat? During a challenge?	Yes, they can. The only exceptions are that recipes can't be used while in combat, and adventure cards that move the ship can't be used while in combat nor while exploring. Otherwise, all players can activate adventure cards, crew board abilities, and ability card abilities during any player's turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3070941/did-we-win-or-lose-this-combat	Did we win or lose this combat?	Page 22 (upper left) of the rule book: "Enemy Health: Each heart must be covered to defeat the enemy." Since your crew did that, I'd say the battle was won.	"Enemy Health: Each heart must be covered to defeat the enemy."
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3067118/are-you-forced-to-spend-artifacts-as-coins	Are you forced to spend artifacts as coins?	I would play it that If you only have artifacts, then you have no coins to lose. This. Artifacts are worth coins, they are not coins.	
	To confirm, the number of achievements is cumulative over sequential campaigns, right?  That is, if I'm correct, one doesn't need to have acquired/completed 22 totems in one game to unlock 173.	Correct. Every time you finish a game you check boxes corresponding to totems you found and the ending you got on the achievement sheet, and once you have 22 of those (accumulated over several campaigns for sure) you unlock card 173.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3059554/what-to-do-when-placing-tokens-already-covered	What to do when placing tokens already covered?	No, you cannot place damage on a square that already has damage. Step 4 explains the rule here: https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#attack-counterattack	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3058777/can-i-equip-an-ability-to-another-crew-member-once	Can I equip an ability to another crew member once equipped?	You can change the owner of a weapon anytime outside of combat. Ability cards, however, cannot be changed. The Rulepop Command reference mentions you can discard equipped ability cards at any time. You can get rid of them, but you'd have to wait until they cycle through the deck in order to reacquire and equip them to someone else. Nope. You cannot swap ability cards once equipped.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3057695/artifacts-what-for	Artifacts - what for.	They are another type of resource (like meat, grain, material etc.)  you can find in the game. These tokens can be spent as 2 coins at any time. There are also some special locations that allow you to spend artifacts to gain rare treasures or effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3051350/search-tokens-resetting-each-time-no-saving	How do you handle the search tokens pile please ?	Just apply rules as written and make a new search pile.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3047439/who-can-be-targeted-by-some-ability-card-abilities	Who can be targeted by some Ability Card abilities?	Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3045240/careful-aim-ability-card	Anyone with an English copy who can check what the text on the ability card "Careful Aim" says?	That card simply gives you +1 Precision but in return that character will receive 1 additional damage every time it's hit by counterattacks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3043563/strange-illness-event-does-it-apply-if-the-1-is-re	Strange Illness event - Does it apply if the 1 is rerolled?	For things like this, I take that to mean when you draw/get affected by a fate of "1" you get the event. Re-rolling/re-drawing from the use of powers - you are literally "changing your fate." Whether it applies to a challenge, a combat roll, or something else your new result replaces the original draw like it never happened - so Strange Illness wouldn't activate. If you run out of re-draws and end on another 1, then you'd get the Strange Illness effect once (you wouldn't get it multiple times for all the 1's you rolled as part of the check).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3041159/for-gain-quest-155-is-the-quest-completed	For "Gain quest 155", is the quest completed?	If I remember correctly, that card has a keyword on it. You keep that card as a token, as a reminder of what results you achieved. The keyword will be referenced by other stories and thereby influence them. Quests only go into the box when you're instructed to discard them. Some quest cards represent the start of a quest and the keyword opens up new story options. Other quest cards represent the end of the quest and they stay in your hand to block alternate story options.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3040505/discard-this-equipped-card-to-skip-an-event-card-s	Discard this equipped card to skip an event card - Skip the effects of the card, or do not draw an event card?	The card isn't skipped - you just don't do the event on the card. This prevents a time-skipping exploit loop. Adventure cards and the like can be used at any time, so it's assumed this one could be too since it's not challenge-based. The answer is to look at the event, and decide if you want to change your fate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3038373/when-to-apply-fatigue	On what occasions does a character get a fatigue token?	It's pretty much just participating in a Challenge that causes fatigue. If you want a character to help, and apply their traits to the Challenge they get 1 fatigue (max 2). Everything else, like participating in combat, using a character's skills on their board, resolving events, explore actions... None of these cause fatigue unless the game specifically tells you it's a consequence of the action you just took. And when that's the case it will be very clear about it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3038359/clarification-of-action-travel	Have I read this incorrectly? It appears to be a clear contradiction. Are you able to have more than one crew member participate in Action: Travel or not? It states in bold you can only choose one then on the next page gives an example of participating 2. Apologies if I have misinterpreted or misread this. Thanks a lot!	I believe the rule on Page 13 is referring to the travel action itself, which you may only choose one additional crewmember to participate (if they have a craft skill). This is to determine how many spaces the Manticore ship may move. However, the example on Page 14, Travel Example 2 is referring to a challenge that was encountered as a result of travelling, and any number of crew members may participate in a challenge (or none at all).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037556/traveling-to-a-new-map	The rule book says "traveling to the page as indicated by the blue arrow "But how about the arrows where there isn't a number ?	Those are the edge of the map.  If you look at your campaign sheet, you’ll see there’s nothing in those directions.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Ability cards: I can only hold 3 in my hand but only 2 equipped? does it mean I can have the maximum number of 5 ability cards in my possession? (2 equipped, 3 unequipped) or just 3? (2 equipped, only 1 unequipped)	3 in your hand. 2 equipped to each character.	
	Can I swap an equipped Ability card with one that is unequipped in my hand?	No.	
	Can I sell unused Ability cards or just discard them? either way, do I shuffle them back in the Ability card deck?	They have no monetary value. You only discard them into the discard pile.	
	Are Ability/Adventure cards a 1 time use? or are they reusable?	Depends on the card and how you use it.	
	Is there a limit to how many Level cards I can equip with the same character?	No. But they may only use their own Level cards.	
	If I can't swap equipped Abilities, can I at least discard them? (let's say I would like another Ability from my hand instead)	Yes.	
	When I discard an Ability card from my hand to get +1 for a challenge, does it matter if I use a different challenge icon on the Ability card then the challenge I'm currently doing? (like discarding a Strength Ability card in a Cunning challenge)	It needs to match the challenge.	
	Can I discard more than 1 Ability card for the same challenge?	Pretty sure you can discard more than one but I can't check the rules at the moment.	
	Where do I put the Event card after I'm done with it? is there a discard pile?	Discard it. It won't be used again this campaign.	
	Are recipes reusable? or are only a 1 time use?	They're reusable.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035945/can-damage-from-an-adventure-card-be-distributed-i	Can damage from an adventure card be distributed in a non-adjacent manner, or does it follow the rules for damage done by players?	All damage from the same attack must be placed adjacently (Rulepop Attack Reference), so it will have to follow the placement rules.However, adventure cards can be used 'anytime,' so it is a separate attack and doesn't have to be adjacent to other damage a character does, and can even be used before a character attacks (e.g. it can be used to disable an enemy's First Strike before anyone even attacks).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035910/setup-question-give-each-player-1-command-and-one	What is a "command card"? Or does it mean "command token"? In regards to the ability cards, do we just get dealt one randomly... or???????	It means to give one command token and one ability card. When the rules refer to gaining or spending those tokens, they are simply referred to as a "command" rather than a "command token". For the ability cards, one is dealt to each player off the top of the deck.	
	Where do they go? Back to the adventure deck? What stops you from going back and getting that again?	The one we encountered I think we put it back in the deck. And if my memory is correct it did not have a keyword that would prevent you from going back and getting it again but this would be a little costly in terms of time to do that over and over again.	
	When can I cook a recipe?	Any time, except during combat (rulebook page 18). “During combat” means any time after you’ve looked at the enemy cards and before they are defeated. If you see there is combat about to happen, the game rules allow you to eat before fighting (thematically, you ate the food before the fight started).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3024266/what-to-keep-for-next-campaign-minor-spoilers	What to keep for next campaign? [Minor SPOILERS]	New campaign is starting over in an alternate timeline. You don’t keep totems or experience and everyone starts out again. You do unlock some bonus options depending on how many totems you found though.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022849/stamina-level-card-of-odessa-what-does-it-mean	Stamina Level Card of Odessa. What does it mean?	It means the character suffers the same affects as having two fatigue tokens, but they can also have a third token. You would need to lose 2 tokens (i.e. have only one token left) to negate the negative effects of having fatigue tokens.(I.e. three tokens is just as bad as two tokens, but usually you can’t have more than two tokens, except with this ability).	
	There is a level card (I believe for Marco) that allows you to substitute one ingredient when cooking a recipe. So once you have that, you can use a meat in a non-meat recipe.	True. We are on a ship though, travelling through an archipelago. So veggies/grain being more rare than fish might be kinda sequitur (TBone pic and all.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022338/when-monsters-atack	When in a combat you have done your 4 attacks and then is the monsters' turn to attack, who do they attack? Who gets the damage?	The active player decides which crew members are attacked by each enemy card.	
	If the event deck runs out while discarding, what should be done?	Count the remaining event cards you need to discard and place an equal number of damage on the event deck slot. The damage is placed here to remind you how many cards you must discard the next time the storybook instructs you to make a new event deck. However, if this is your third time through the event deck, you don’t need to keep track because you won’t be making a new event deck.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3021808/can-a-crew-member-have-the-same-ability-card-equip	Can a crew member have the same ability card equipped twice?	you can have the same card equipped if you paid for it. nothing in the rules states otherwise or impose any kind of limits.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3019810/doubt-event-card	When a card asks you for a challenge and for it you do an action, does that mean it has to be one of the two ship actions? Or can you do that challenge at any time?	Yes it’s an action. I don’t have the card in front of me, but some events make you do it right away, others apply a negative effect until you remove it with an action at your choice of time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018777/items-that-give-block	For items that give block (such as the serpent scale vest in the rulebook), does the item give that block bonus for one hit?  Or for the entire combat?  I realize it's "temporary," but I'm not sure how temporary.	It only applies to a single attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018188/using-multiple-crew-abilities-allowed-or-just-one	Using multiple crew abilities allowed or just one at a time?	Correct. You have to clear the command token before using an ability on that crew member again	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018065/when-using-the-stone-of-blood-does-the-bonus-damag	When using the Stone of Blood, does the bonus damage have to be placed continuously with other damage or can it go anywhere on a monster card?	The adventure cards can be used 'at any time,' meaning they don't have to be part of a specific attack, or even part of an attack in general - they are a separate instance of damage. This damage can be combined with the total damage of an attack, applied to a different non-contiguous square or on another monster, or even used before an attack to disable a monster ability.	
	Can Stone of Blood (45) be combined with an attack that does 1 damage to cover a heart worth 2?	Yes. The Stone of Blood is dealing 1 damage, not +1 damage. You can use it to snipe a damage out without suffering counterattack, or combine it with your attack to hit a 2 or 3 heart space.	
  	in comabt - can I use other member abilities?	Generally, the attack based abilities (+1 damage, +1 accuracy, block, etc.) can only be used by the crew member themselves. Some other abilities, like ones that remove status effects or affect fate draws can be used for anyone. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#crew-board	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3016298/why-do-you-get-less-command-tokens-if-playing-with	Why do you get less command tokens if playing with fewer players.	When you help another player for a challenge, i.e., use one of your character's icons for a challenge during another player's turn, you need to pay a command. Same if you want to give one of your combat cubes to another player. This obviously happens more often with more players.	
	Solo Play - Command Tokens - do they accumulate.	You have 5. But be aware they are a limited component, so there is only a certain number available to the players.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3012276/do-discarded-ability-cards-go-to-the-bottom-of-the	Do discarded ability cards go to the bottom of the gate deck?	Rulebook, p. 10 under Ship Action: "If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck."...so, you create a discard pile and reshuffle it as needed.	"If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck."
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3012264/omg-new-to-the-game-and-can-t-find-the-answer-in-t	What happens when a single crew member has no health left?	 They don't die, they just can't do anything. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health. Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt.	
	Which brings up another question...do we keep the totem cards we found in previous campaigns for the next?	No. Except the specific Quest Card unlocked depending on the number of totems you don't keep anything. So, no totem.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3008941/can-you-keep-repeating-explore-triggers-to-gain-th	Can you keep repeating explore triggers to gain the same resource over and over? Also, can there be "negative" numbers?	1) You are not allowed to repeat a specific story choice/decision in the same Exploration action.  This is outlined in the rules. 2) Challenge results never go less than 0.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3008936/paying-fatigue-when-a-crew-member-is-specifically	Paying fatigue when a crew member is specifically named in a challenge?	In general, specific crew are just mentioned as flavor text and you don’t have to use them specifically. It may depend on the specific section though. I’ve seen some challenges that specifically *restrict* a character from participating, but I don’t think anyone is ever compelled to. In this case it specifically said that a crew member was attempting to navigate the ship to safety, then in the actual challenge it said that only this crew member was allowed to be used. It didn't state that you had to use him, but as the flavour text had mentioned that the crew member had been attempting to steer the ship already it felt a bit like I had to use him. Not to use him would had felt a bit meta-gaming in my opinion and this is why I wondered if I was also obliged to place a fatigue token on him according to the rules.Anyway, thanks for your replies. Navigation doesn’t require a crew member to participate, so I would say it’s that crew member or no one.  If that crew member was already over fatigued then it would have to be no one. It says you don't have to, so you don't have to. Fatigue and skill checks are about effort. How much effort did he do? More or less? I know the check you're talking about. The point isn't to make you use him, the point is he's the only option if you try to use anyone. I think saying to not use him is metagaming is ignoring unambiguous instructions they gave you  They give a lot for instructions like that so I'd be worried you're unnecessarily tying your hands a lot in the game. If this is a reoccurring thing in the game then on the one hand I would say it's important for me to get the answer to this question, as I will most likely get stuck on it every time it happens in the future otherwise. Secondly I would say that if they are going to keep mentioning specific crew members and in the "narration" refer to them performing an action which - according to the rules - I actually don't need to assign them to, then the rules could probably need some rewriting on this point.Again, thanks everyone for answering my question.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3007243/final-score-and-market-cards	Final Score:"Gain 2 points per adventure card" What happenend with the Market Cards? Scoring 2 points or zero points?	Zero points per market card. Since they're much easier to get than adventure cards, you're not rewarded for having them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3006784/do-you-have-to-use-1-command-token-per-low-morale	Do you have to use 1 command token per low morale!	A crew member can have only 1 of each type of status-token. So a crewmember can never have 2 low morale.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3006772/does-venom-activate-outside-of-combat-as-well	Does venom activate outside of combat as well	Yes. Poison is real bad.	
	If untreated, will venom continue to -1 health on each players turn OUTSIDE of combat?	yes	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	When I place a command token on a character ability to activate it, how long does that stay active?	All abilities, whether they are from character boards, adventure cards or the small cards (can't remember their name) are one time use. So, if you block one damage using an ability, you block a single damage for the cost of 1 command, that's it. No less, no more.	
	If they have a vest with a block ability that takes 1 command to activate, how long does it stay active after I assign a command token to it?	All abilities, whether they are from character boards, adventure cards or the small cards are one time use. So, if you block one damage using an ability, you block a single damage for the cost of 1 command, that's it. No less, no more.	
	Does it only work once in combat, or does it stay active until that combat is over?	All abilities are one time use. Note that on ability cards the command token goes back to the supply. So you can keep using them if you have more command tokens. Adventure cards/Market Cards and crew abilities, the command tokens stay on the card and cannot be used again until the tokens are cleared from them.	
	Also, having venom in a solo game kinda sucks right, as every turn its one damage i assume.	With venom, “The crew member takes 1 damage at the start of each player’s turn.” So, the number of players doesn’t change anything.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005524/end-of-combat-round-enemy-attack	If I’m playing 2 player.. and i am the active player, can i send this damage over to one of player 2’s characters?	Yes. In combat, all players are considered active and can use the combat tokens in any order as well as spilling excess damage to other crew members (regardless of which player controls them).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005442/accuracy-abilities-vs-fate-abilities-and-redraw-fa	Can I use adventure card fate abilities here as well? Can I spend a command token on gear to redraw fate instead?	Yes you can use adventure card abilities after drawing Fate to modify the outcome.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3002094/adding-and-removing-fatigue-tokens-french-translat	what is the correct way to place tokens?	You take the first token blank side up. You take the second token penalty side up to show the character now has -1.	
	If a crew member has 2 fatigue (in my case only 1 token on it) should I remove the fatigue token, or simply revert it to the blank side?	When to lose a fatigue, remove the one with the penalty side up first if you have one, then the blank one the next time.	
	Equipment: Armors should be equipped into a crew member or captain, or are available as generic option as cooking recipes?	Armour cards (like weapons) must be equipped (given to a crewmember) to be used by that crewmember. As long as you are not in combat, you can give armour and weapons to a different crewmember at any time.	
	Equipment: Weapons can be changed before each combat or once they have been attached to a crew member, they should stay there?	As long as you are not in combat, you can give armour and weapons to a different crewmember at any time.	
	Combat: During a combat, after give the synergy token to another crew member, is it mandatory to consume this token after attack or could be kept without using the advantage provided by it, but without returning it?	The synergy token does not need to be used ('may'), but only lasts until the end of that combat. When you start combat against a new monster, step 3 of combat setup is to replace synergy on their owner's board.	
	But weapons have to be equipped to a character, haven't they?	They do, yes. And you can give them to other characters any time out of combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3001894/are-permanent-level-cards-removed-after-the-set-of	Are permanent level cards removed after the set of 18 is done?	I played only one evening so far but the permanent event cards I had clearly stated to discard them when the event pile is finished.	
	After the 18 levels of one of the 3 runs, one needs to discard the pile of level cards and create a new stack of 6 mild/normal/heavy cards. If there are still permanent level cards (like "gain a ship damage on every Fate 1 unless you solve a Strength 8"), will these be removed as well?	Ongoing event cards (like the one you describe) remain after each run through of the event deck until you've run through the event deck 3 times and thus completed a campaign. Most of the ongoing event cards have actions on them that you can take either as one of your 2 actions or at the end of your turn to attempt to resolve them. Since they stick around when you make a new event deck, I find it's generally good to get rid of them relatively soon.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3000221/clarifying-some-rules	When attacking an enemy with wings, with a regular weapon (not ranged); if I decide to apply the damage to the wing first, does the +1 defence for the enemy still apply? E.g. I can do 3 damage to an enemy with a regular (not ranged) weapon. Does the wing still require 2 damage?	Crew members must meet or exceed an enemy's defense in order to hit it with an attack. If you hit, it doesn't have any effect on damage. So, an enemy with fly ability is more difficult to hit if your weapon isn't ranged. Each flying icon in the enemy grid should only take one damage to cover. Once they're all covered, the enemy no longer has the ability.	
	Do all ability cards always have to be equipped before you can use the effect?	Yes. Until an ability card is equipped, a crew member cannot use its ability or gain the bonus to the skill on the card. While in hand, you can either spend command to equip it, or discard it to aid in a challenge.	
	Do characters die in battle?	The characters don't die but, according to the rules 'Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2997393/solo-game	Can I play solo?	yes. It is excellent solo, many people play it that way. And quite a few think it's actually the ideal number. This is a game where all player counts are on equal footing because they appeal to different types of folks.	
	So I play with all the crew members. Why I use fewer ability cards? It’s written on the rules?	Yes: rules say that 1 ability card per player as a starting point (and not crew member). Later on, there is a limit of 3 per player - so in solo that is still 3 max!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2995206/weapon-says-gain-low-morale-when-used	If my weapon says when used gain low morale, does this apply to the weapon holder and the weapon is unusable if they have low morale, or can the low morale be given to a different crew member when using the weapon?	If it's just the Low Morale symbol, you can give it to anyone.  If it says "This Crew Member" it has to be the one using the weapon.  You can play it either way.  I would justify it as either the weapon makes the user feel like it's stealing their soul so they gain low morale.  OR. if another character gains the Low Morale, that crew member can be terrified of the other crew members power.  Kinda like Sam watching Frodo fall to the power of the ring.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2994999/replaying-event-locations	It seems there are some numbered locations that you can visit again and again. I'm wondering if I'm missing something or if there is something missing with the translation of the game (I have the french edition) because sometimes it doesn't make sense. For instance: on location 6 (p14 of the map book): You find a recently abandonned camp you can either loot or wait for the camper to come back. First time I went there, I waited, the group came back and they were mad at me and I run away with a coin. If I go there a second time, nothing tells me that something has changed. I can just do the same thing again or choose the other option, and the same groupe come back again? That's a bit weird	Yes, you can repeat it. The things you can't repeat are controlled by keywords on the quest cards.The question is 'is it worth it'?You only have a limited number of turns to complete your campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2992406/what-happens-to-defeated-enemies-when-all-crew-is	What happens to defeated enemies when all crew is down to 0 health	Damage of enemies is only tracked with the fight itself. As soon as the fight is over (including when you are defeated) any subsequent fight is a treated as a completely new fight, so you start with all enemies at full health.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2991132/ability-and-level-cards-also-skills-on-crew-boards	After going thru the 18 event cards, the story rules say to discard all equipped ability cards. Do you shuffle the ability deck at that point?	They are discarded but you’re not instructed to shuffle. So no, you have to wait till the deck runs out. There are multiple copies of each card though I believe.	
	After playing through a campaign (54 event cards), do my crew members get to keep their level cards for the next campaign?	Level cards do not carry over to the next campaign. I agree that some are terrific and some of them are pretty underwhelming. But you’re going to be getting plenty of XP no matter what. So you might as well grab them for the Skill symbol if nothing else and make challenges easier.	
	I'm still unclear on when I can use the printed skill symbols to assist in a challenge. If another crew makes a strength challenge, can Rafael add in his strength point after fate has been drawn?	You have to declare who is part of the Challenge and spend Fatigue prior to flipping the card. That’s part of the risk/reward. You can play skill cards from hand AFTER you draw fate to modify though (as well as spend command to action cards or character abilities).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2971238/what-means-the-plus-before-the-accuracy-number-ob	What means the + before the accuracy number on the crew weapons?	The plus # is your starting accuracy. Use that number, plus the drawn fate number, to determine whether you hit an enemy.	
	Can I add starting weapon accuracy and accuracy of added weapons or added ability cards together?	No.  You use either your starting weapon or an equipped weapon.  Not both.	
	Can I add starting weapon accuracy and accuracy of added weapons or added ability cards together?	No.  You use either your starting weapon or an equipped weapon.  Not both. Just wanted to also add that this decision is made for each attack, not per combat. A character attacking multiple times in a combat can choose different weapons each time.	
	Just to understand your comment about "discarding some ability cards you might have wanted to play" -- I'm supposed to draw cards from the top of the shuffled ability deck, right? Not play cards from my hand?	Yes, you discard from the deck. But consider: the higher the fate on the card, the more powerful of an effect it has when you play it to your crew!	
	Is there an official ruling/FAQ?	This was answered in another thread here. You can only use one character but other players may discard ability cards. And any player may spend command to action cards to augment the challenge as normal.	
	The rules said: Draw 1 ability card and gain the specified number of command tokens. It seemed to me that it was about the specified number on the ability card, but now I understand it isn't..	For clarification on Rulespop: Ship room effects vary depending on the number of players in the game. When a room shows two numbers over the command token symbol, check the player count symbol at the top right corner of the ship board. This tells you what amount of command to take (depending on the number of players).Player Count When playing with 3–4 players, use the side of the ship board that has this symbol.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2966219/reading-events	When reading events, if it calls for a test or something does it work same way as a challenge? Like someone is picked and fatigued and other people can add more if they wish, etc?	Yeah absolutely, you can as always choose whether or not you want crew members to participate, following standard challenge rules.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2960505/battle	If you use the last cube and fight the last monster in play, but he isn't dead, Did he attack twice? One time for reaction and one time for end round?	Yes, that's correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2960501/travel	If you can move up to 3 spaces with your travel action. Can you move 1 space, do your second action in that space then move after that another 2 spaces?	No. Travel counts as one of your actions. You must complete one action before beginning another. Of course you don’t have to move all 3 spaces in your action as you could just choose to move 1 or 2.	
	Can effects that change the chance to hit be used after you reveal fate?	Yes: From page 23: “After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy.” Are you referring to this or another type of effect?	“After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy.”
	Can any player pay the command to activate character board abilities, or only the controlling player?	Only the controlling player	
	When changing pages, can you pick any space on the new page on the entering side, or do you need to “line up” with your exit from the previous page?	Any space	
	Will the Sea Serpent token follow us even if we move to a new page? Across multiple pages? What if we use an effect to arrive at a new space but not by “travel”?	It will follow you wherever you go. Page 12:  “ Hunting Serpent Special Rule: For this event, if you turn to a new page of the atlas, place the serpent on the region your ship starts in.”	“ Hunting Serpent Special Rule: For this event, if you turn to a new page of the atlas, place the serpent on the region your ship starts in.”

After you 'draw fate', you discard the card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2920592/low-morale	Do low morale tokens actually matter when playing solo? I can’t see a point in them	They absolutely do! Forces you to use a command token and a fatigue to activate a crew member, when normally they would just get fatigue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2919349/can-you-use-adventure-cards-and-crew-abilities-if	Can you use adventure cards and crew abilities if they have command tokens on them?	You cannot use crew abilities (any) or normal ability cards if they have command one them. The command would need to be cleared first.A weapon typically does not have an ability like an ability card and does not get command on it. You can recognise that by the command icon (the blue token).

Perception: Used to search, use hand-eye coordination, detect, or use senses. Also used to hide and sneak. Hope that helps.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2908405/using-command-during-combat-from-another-character	Can I use command from a crew ability that is not participating on an attack to give accuracy or even more damage to the attack?	Generally speaking, no. There are a few crew abilities that can be used on other characters (such as the fate/status ones) - but the combat-related ones (damage/block/accuracy) can only be used on that specific character when they are making an attack.https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#crew-board	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2906621/fate-symbols-on-ship-board	Fate Symbols on Ship board?	When the ship is damaged you draw fate and assign the damage cubes to the relevant location.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905797/covering-squares-in-combat	In order to cover a square, is it enough one damage for all except for hearts with numbers?	Yes you only need to do 1 damage to cover up a 3 attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905767/kasumi-s-synergy-token	Can Kasumi’ synergy token (+1 damage) be used when missing the target? That is, after the counterattack, can I deal 2 damages?	Yes.	
	Why would I cover empty spaces? I don't get why it would help since we cannot skip spaces. It doesn't help with adjacency for another hit right?	you would not want to cover empty space, but sometimes you can not avoid it. For example, you deal 3 damage and then cover a 2-valued heart, if the adjacent spaces are empty, you cannot avoid to cover an empty space with your third damage.	
	I think Rafael has one level up card that allows him to only have to place 1 damage on his initial target and then he can place the rest on an adjacent enemy. This way, you can use an enemy with low defense to land the hit, and roll over damage into an enemy with a high defense.		
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904637/travel-test	To travel we need to do a craft challenge. It's I can choose only one crew member for that test. Is that a regular difference among other action and types of challenges in the game? Do I need to memorize these differences?	Only one crew member is used for travel, but you don't have to use a crew member. Travel is different than other challenges as it is an action.https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#travel	
	Also the negative effects always have to go on a character that participated on the challenge? Or can I give to someone else?	Negative effects are applied to crew that participated first.	
	If I'm not successful on a test I receive the penalty. But I still proceed normally with the instructions right? Or in the case of travel on a hazard place, for example, I would still move there right?	Correct. Negative effects are applied and then you proceed normally.	
	The Travel section in the rules state:” You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total.”	Yes, but it doesn't mention using adventure cards or other crew abilities using command. So it seems different from the regular challenge. And I was wondering if that's accurate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904319/sleeping-gods-as-an-action-question	Certain negative ongoing events in Sleeping Gods state on their cards that "as an action" one may attempt a certain challenge (e.g., a STRENGTH 7 check) to remove the event.Does this mean that you can try using up one of your two actions at the final part of your turn to attempt this challenge and remove the event? Or, does it mean you can attempt the challenge once per turn at will on your turn (without using up either of your usual two actions) to try and get rid of the event?	It's the first one - it uses one of your 2 actions in your turn to attempt the challenge to overcome it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2900838/ignore-a-hazard-after-the-check	Ignore a hazard after the check?	I would rule it allows you to ignore the requirement of rolling, but if you choose to roll anyway, you must accept the outcome of the roll.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2898953/dungeon-item-hearthcoal-move-ship-3-distance	Should this item be used as part of the Travel action, or can it be used any time assuming it does not cost an action?	The latter seems the intended use of this item.	
	My second query was whether it is considered an action or not.	My logic tells me it's not an action as the rulebook does not refer to it as an action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2897149/crew-abilities	When a crew ability is doing two actions, e.g. removing a status token + recovering one health, as in the following picture, can those be applied to different crew members?	You can only activate one crew ability at a time, and would need to remove command from that crew member before attempting to use another ability of that member: 'Activate Crew AbilityYou may pay command to activate one of your crew member’s abilities. Place the required command on their crew board to indicate that they have used an ability, then gain the effects. You may not use another ability on this crew member until all command tokens have been removed from their crew board.'	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2896109/defeated-in-normal-mode-and-event-deck	If I am defeated in normal mode, I should discard 6 cards from the event deck. If after discarding a few cards (less than 6), I run out of event cards, should I read paragraph 1 and afterwards continue discarding cards up to 6, or should I shuffle the event deck, discard up to six, finish my turn and then read paragraph 1?	It's #1. Discard as many as you can. Read the paragraph, (which will tell you to create a new deck of 18) Then discard the rest of what you owe off of the new deck.	
	One thing I do not understand is that it specifically tells you to discard 6 cards from the event deck AFTER you build the new deck, which means pretty much "discard all mild event cards". Why don't the rules just say to discard the mild event cards when creating a new deck of 18 cards? Am I missing something here?	The 6 cards that I discard when defeated are supposed to be the time while I go back to port. If I cannot discard all 6 cards and the deck is empty, I have not come back to port yet and I am still unconscious when reading paragraph 1 and facing the monster. If, on the contrary, even if I have not discarded 6 cards yet when the deck is empty, I am supposed to be recovered, this is not coherent with the 6 discarded cards simulating the time I spend coming back to port, isn’t it?	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2895465/laurents-level-card-old-sailor-player-count-clarif	Does this only activate when the player controlling Laurent goes to the bridge?	Correct.	
	If during a combat round my fate is only 1-2, and I thereby miss, do I still get to hit for one damage, or is that considered an attack and therefore nullified by Frightened?	Not certain, but I believe frightened stops you from choosing that character. They weren't frightened when you chose them. Their miss still causes 1 damage, they become frightened, and you can't use them again in combat until frightened is removed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2894053/duplicating-actionsabilities	If on Action 1 I explore a location and receive some reward, can I simply explore the same location for Action 2 and receive the same reward? And do it again on a subsequent turn (perhaps the very next one)? If yes, is that even true in a case where there are no complexities like keywords or challenges, and therefore the outcome is guaranteed to be the same? Rules seem to permit this, thought it doesn't seem logical.	Yes, you can explore again for you second action, but be aware that most locations give you cards with keywords preventing you claiming strong rewards more than once.	
	Can I equip a single crew member with two identical ability cards? For example, can one crew member have two Bandages cards?	Yes	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2893834/search-token-low-morale	I have obtained a search token in the Deck (ship action). What does this search token mean?	According to the following rule, it gives you 1 coin and 1 low morale. However, according to the rules, status tokens are only obtained in stories and combat (this does not include the deck).	
	Which test? I did not performed any test. I was just in the ship action (deck).	It means you found 1 coin and 1 character gets low morale.Since you are playing solo, you can assign low morale to any of your characters.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2889652/crew-abilities	During a challenge, is it only crew members who are assigned to the task (and got fatigued) who can use their starting abilities (or equipped ones) to help swing the outcome after the fate draw, or can any crew member use their abilities effects to help so long as they pay the command cost?	It depends. If it says 'you', then only the player drawing a fate card can use one of their committed characters.	
	FOOD - One of the adventure cards shown, Alexei, says we can trade food for meat. What is food?	Grain and vegetables. So 1 grain for 1 meat etc.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2884404/when-does-combat-or-a-challenge-start	When does Combat or a Challenge start?	It starts when you reveal the cards. You can cook and do other actions even after finding out the level of difficulty of the combat but not after you see the adversaries you’ll be fighting.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2881308/travel-challenges	When doing a Travel action, do you have to complete hazard challenges if you are only passing through the area i.e. your Craft challenge lets you move 2 regions, landing you in a hazard-free region, but passing through a region with a hazard?	Yes, but if you fail you can keep moving through you just take the negative effect.	
	Where is it stated in the rule book that there's a hand limit?	Page 6 in the rules: Hand Limit Each player has a hand limit of 3 ability cards. Whenever you draw new ability cards, after you have drawn, if you have more than 3 cards in hand, you must immediately discard until you have only 3 (you may choose which cards to discard)	
	Does Gloria’s ability let you draw 2 cards on a fate draw, or draw 2 cards into your hand?	Gloria’s ability lets you draw ability cards into your hand. Her ability cannot be used on fate draws. You can use it at any time. Note: Remember hand limit of 3, so if you ever have 4+ cards in hand, you must discard down.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2880540/herbalist-restores-6-health-total-or-per-crew-memb	Herbalist: restores 6 health total or per crew member?	Based on wording, the 6 health is in total, and the remove all status tokens is for all crew members. If the 6 health were supposed to be removed for all crew members, the sentence would have said, "Restore 6 health and remove all status tokens FOR all crew members." Granted ... the wording could have been more clear.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879839/accuracy-on-an-attack	Could someone please explain how step 3 of "attack and counterattack" works?	"Draw fate and add that number to the weapon’s accuracy number. This total must meet or exceed the targeted enemy defense number in order to hit. Otherwise, you miss. After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy."	
	Then why does it say "you may use adventure card" abilities that add to accuracy after the draw?	You can use any adventure card - they belong to the whole crew, as it were - whereas the crew boards themselves have attack/damage bonuses specific to each crew member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879442/a-bunch-of-questions	Does it cost command to use the captain during a challenge?	No	
	Is there anything in the rules that stop you from farming a location that gives you resources?	In a non city location, you are usually instructed to return to the ship. So you can farm as long as you're willing to spend time on it, unless a keyword tells you otherwise obviously (like if you get the first time, get resources and the keyword "NOMORERESOURCES", and the next time you go there it tells you "if you do not have the keyword NOMORERESOURCES"). The only thing that stops you from farming a location is the time limit of the game. You will go through the event deck a certain amount of times until the game ends. Wasting precious time farming a location won't do you any good. Keep in mind though, you are only allowed to pick each option once PER explore option. So lets say you have the choices: A. Buy goods (pay 1 coin, gain 1 grain) B. Sell goods (pay 1 grain, gain 1 coin) C. Return to the ship. You can not stay there buying/selling as much as you want. The most you can do is buy once, sell once, then return to the ship.	
	Can ability cards be traded among players?	No	
	During a turn, can a non-turn player pay the command token cost to activate one of the shared adventure cards?	Yes	
	Can you use the equipped, repair action ability card more than once a turn assuming you can pay the cost?	Yes, the command token does not stay on the card as for adventure cards	
	Does the captain having low morale make any difference?	Yes, you must pay command to use her	
	Can you choose to do less than the designated amount of damage?	No	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2877318/using-ability-cards-to-help-other-characters-durin	If I am attacking with the captain, can I use Kannan’s equipped ability card “focus” to add +3 accuracy to the captain’s date card draw? Or can only Kannan use “focus”?	Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card. But also note that if a card says "you", it means you, the player, not you, the character: "If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped. "	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2877146/changing-player-count-mid-campaign	Can you change the number of players mid campaign? If so, how?	You play the same 9 characters no matter the player count, so it's pretty easy to divvy them up however you like.	
	Discard 1 ability card from hand? Or from one of their characters? What happens if there are no cards in that player’s hand to discard?	Since it doesn't say an "equipped ability card", then it's a card in hand. If there's no card in hand, then I imagine it's fine. Part of the reason you're discarding a card and all but 1 command is because removing a player may end up dropping you pass the threshold to flip the board---board costs and rewards have different values for lower player counts.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2875448/question-about-skill-challenges-and-equipped-abili	In the pictured example Player 2 has the above Marco and he has a Cunning ability card equipped. If player 1 is captain and a Cunning skill challenge is encountered, Player 2 wishes to participate as well with Marco. We understand you expend one command token to participate in a challenge if you not the captain AND every participating character will get a fatigue token. The question I want to know is do we spend an extra command token to utilize the 2nd Cunning equipped to Marco so he can contribute 2 Cunning to the challenge or because the equipped ability card has already been equipped, no additional command tokens need to be used? Thanks in Advance.	You get the 2 cunning every time; the command cost is 1, as you say; but you add all the extra abilities for equipped ability + level cards, to the base on your character sheet, for no additional cost.	
	Player 1 is the captain and has encountered a Cunning challenge. Player 2 has no characters with any Cunning skills so he does not wish to use any characters but he does have a Cunning ability card in hand he wishes to discard during the "Alter Fate" step to help influence the total skill number for the challenge. Does Player 2 need to spend a command token in this scenario? My guess is no as the command token is only spent during the "Gather Crew" step.	Correct.  Either player can discard cards from hand to add to the Challenge, using matching ability cards.  We tend to be fairly liberal about how we allow our players to talk about what's in hand, though technically you're not supposed to talk about that.  We like the co-op aspect of saying "I can thrown in a card to help you with that".	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2874228/what-are-the-coin-values	What are the coin values?	I guess it can be whatever you want! We treat them as 1 and 5.	
	It was my first instinct also, but it does matter if you even run out of coins as they are limited I believe? Although I think the chance of running out is low?	if i am ever in danger of running out of coins, i'm getting myself to the Marketplace, ASAP!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2873881/i-have-some-questions-after-first-session	During combat, can you discard an equipped item with a command token?	Depends on what you mean. Some ability cards have the ability to discard themselves (when equipped). This will explicitly state so on the card itself. Also: you never put command on ability cards (that command just goes back to the supply). Weapon (not sure whether you meant this instead by 'item') cannot be discarded or re-equipped, and cannot have command on them.	
	During another players turns challenge, if you simply discard a card to boost the value without using one of your character, do you still spend a command token?	Yes, quoting rulepop: "Any player may also discard ability cards in hand to give +1 skill of the type specified on the card. Players may discard any number of ability cards."	
	What is the significance of the combat token?	They are use to count the amount of attacks you have in a given combat round (=4); and you cannot place more than 2 tokens on the same crew member. You use the combat token to indicate who is attacking the monster(s). I.o.w.: you don't let all of your crew members attack the monsters one after another (that would make combat VERY easy).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2867308/character-abilitiesequipment-can-be-used-by-anyone	Character abilities/equipment can be used by anyone?	No, as per rulepop under crew member/+1 damage: "This can only be added to an attack the crew member performs. The damage cannot be dealt by itself, and it cannot be added to another crew member’s attack. ", same for +1 accuracy. Weapons can be swapped, but ability cards can't. All other rewards/cards are shared, and they can be used by any player/crew member, provided they can pay the command cost, and the card does not already have command on it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2866449/adventure-card-88-clarification-spoiler	Does this mean to take the synergy token from one crew member, regardless of using them to fight, and place it on another crew member where it is available to be activated?	It means any character can pay 2 command to place any character's synergy token on another player. It allows you to get a character's token into play without them having to fight, and without anyone having to mark a synergy space on a monster. Useful for example to put Gregory's token on a player just before they take damage that would reduce them to zero health.	
	Can you do this outside of combat to set this up ahead of time, or only once combat has commenced?	Not a good idea, as setting up combat places each character's synergy token back on their own board.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2862650/gregory-synergy	Can you give the synergy to a crew who has already hit 0 to bring them back, or must this be on a crew at the time they hit 0 in order to activate?	No, from the wording of the synergy token in the rulebook, it's when the crew member hits 0. It's too late if they already are. I use this as protection usually for a crew member that's low on health, but a heavy hitter. Where they would be reduced to zero after an attack, if they have Gregory's synergy token they use it so as not to be defeated and possibly make another (victorious) attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2859162/defeat-plus-depleted-event-deck	Do I take a normal ship action prior to reading paragraph 1.2 since I'm just coming back from death and technically starting a new turn?	yes, im pretty sure that, if you are defeated, you'll need to discard the next 9 cards.	
	Since I was instructed to discard 6 event deck cards going back to when I was defeated, and still have 3 cards to remove due to that fact, do those remaining 3 discards stack with the 6 I will need to discard from failing combat during paragraph 1.2?	yes, im pretty sure that, if you are defeated, you'll need to discard the next 9 cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2858350/storybook-takes-me-back-to-step-one	If I take an explore action as my first action to explore a number on the map, I find that number in the storybook and read the text and make whatever choices it asks me to do. That's easy enough. However, sometimes the story branches out and ultimately sends me back to step one where I started reading. When that happens, am I free to choose another branch and explore without using a second exploration action? Or would it count as my second action of the turn should I decide to read another branch?	Exploring a Town/CitySome stories start with a town or city name in bold. In this case, the story structure often allows you to select all of the various choices in the same visit, one by one. You may not, however, select the same choice more than once during each explore action at the town/city. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#explore	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855852/when-can-you-move-equipment	When can you move equipment?	You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only the weapon info is showing.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855502/cooking-flapjacks-clarification-needed	I see that the "Flapjacks" card has an ability to remove 3 x health tokens and 3 x fatigue tokens from a crew member. My question is, can I split that to heal one character while removing fatigue from another? Or does the card collectively apply to only one crew member?	Fortunately for you, it's neither of those!  You can remove any 3 fatigue and damage tokens you'd like, from any characters and in any combination.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855483/exploring-while-traveling	If I take a travel action and I'm rewarded with two ship moves, am I allowed to stop in the first region and take an explore action before moving into the second region?	You don’t have to take two move steps, but when you stop after one, the rest is forfeit. So, if you take one move and stop, that would be the first action of your turn. And exploring would be the second action of your turn.	
	Mac's +1 to fate to fate draw - can this be used during other players' or crew members' fate draws during combat?	I use it for anyone participating in combat, but I may be wrong?...? Yes.

I am assuming that we are able to come back here after having gained the keyword ABSYMAL from this location, which has the keyword ABSYMAL, with another explore action, as we have already 'returned to ship' from our previous action. However, from a linear story standpoint, this keyword is gained knowledge from the same location and section of story that requires the keyword. Can players then come back with a gained keyword in situations like this?	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2853108/port-inn-action-question	Small thing with wording, but I have a question about the Port Inn Action. Seems like it would apply to all crew members in the game, but do the benefits of the Port Inn Action ("each crew member restores 2 health and removes 1 fatigue) apply to all crew members or only the current player's crew members?	All crew members. Including other players.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2852034/end-of-each-event-deck	Where is this "discard all equipped ability cards" rule documented? I don't see it anywhere in the rule book.	It's part of the instructions in the storybook when you complete the "end-of-event-deck" story encounter.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2851199/spoiler-starting-the-second-campaign	At the end of our ordeal, we were instructed to place Laurent back in game box.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2849626/regular-challenges-vs-travel-challenges	Is it correct that for the craft challenge performed during the travel action, you can use at most one crew member?	Yes, you can only use 1 crew member for the specific Craft challenge during the Travel Action. This is because thematically, only 1 person can ultimately pilot the ship at a time.	
	Are any or all of these intended to be deviations from the normal challenge procedure?	Yes, the deviations are intended. For the Travel Action Craft challenge, other players cannot support you with their crew members, and there are specific rules about discarding ability cards and using crew and adventure cards.	
	So in every other respect, it's just like a regular challenge?	Yes, in every other respect, it's just like a regular challenge. Crew board abilities, ability card abilities, adventure card abilities from both players are allowed, as well as ability card discarding from both players. The only difference is the limitation on crew members.

You can only use crew board abilities of crew members under your control	
	When using adventure/market cards to heal or remove fatigue, can this be split amongst players and or crew members, or is it only for the player placing the command token on the card.	All benefits from all adventure cards can be assigned to any and all crew members, including spreading benefits from recipes among crew. So adventure cards are not limited to your own crew.	
	When using adventure/market cards to heal or remove fatigue, can this be split amongst players and or crew members, or is it only for the player placing the command token on the card.	Benefits from adventure cards can be shared among all crew members as they all share in their ownership but my question regards the paying of command tokens to activate them. Say an adventure card requires three command tokens to activate - can the cost be likewise shared to come up with the required amount? I cannot find a rule reference that says that such cards can only be activated from an individual crew member's command token stock. We've house ruled that the command tokens to activate a card can come from anyone with tokens available to spend. I'm thinking specifically about responding to Event Cards but other challenges, even combat, may be implicated?	
	When using adventure/market cards to heal or remove fatigue, can this be split amongst players and or crew members, or is it only for the player placing the command token on the card.	I think the answer to your question is written in "what players share" on the rulebook. Players don't share their command tokens, so no, they can't spend their command to help the active player activate something.

	What do I do with completed event cards? Do I just have a discard pile of them? When I create the event deck the second (and third times) do I shuffle each time, or do the exact same order?	On the event deck, yes. Just start a discard pile. At the event at the end of each time through the desk you will get instructions on how to remake it.	
	Brenna said in other threads that it can be to any character, not just the ones you control.	Yes, to any of the characters you control.	
	Am I the only one struggling with this rule book? I feel like there a lot of things missing. Or maybe I just suck at finding them.	Not at all!When we started to play, it seems a lot of stuff in the rules were taken for granted that you knew. It felt like Ryan Laukat believed that we've all played his earlier games.I would love to continue the game, but we have to find a really precise "how to play" on youtube first. The rule book simply doesn't cut it.We've also read it from start to finish and had a lot of questions.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2843686/unexpected-leak-sea-serpent-plus-defeat-in-normal	So basically if I get defeated while playing normal mode and go back to port; should i keep the recurring event cards like the sea serpent / leak ones or they get discarded?	You've played that right. By RAW these stay unfortunately.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2841162/possible-to-re-gain-a-completed-quest	Possible to re-gain a completed quest?	If you've already gained a quest, then you can't gain it a second time, so if the storybook instructs you to gain that same quest again, you just ignore that part.	
	What would have happened then?	Based on the nature of that keyword and what it involves, I'm guessing they wanted there to be more than 1 way to be able to find it. So I would guess if you come across twice in the same playthrough, just ignore the second instance.	
	This is also covered in the rules for Quest Cards:	When the storybook says “Lose quest x,” or “Complete quest x,” place the specified card in the used quest box. Once quests are in this box, you cannot retrieve them (unless you are resetting the game for a new campaign).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838484/how-to-re-prepare-the-event-deck	How to re-prepare the event deck	You only discard the 6 event cards if the crew was defeated or the boat was destroyed.	
	When we finish the event deck and read the proper paragraph in the story book, it says to create a new event deck. Elsewhere in the rules, it says to discard 6 event cards. I'm confused about this. Since there are normally six mild event cards on top, if I have to discard six, why would I even bother shuffling the mild event cards?  Why doesn't the storybook say anything about discarding six cards?  On the 3rd time through, do I discard 12 cards?  What exactly is the proper procedure for re-preparing the event deck?	Should your crew of ship be defeated, that's when you discard 6 events cards. but not beyond the current event deck (i.o.w.: they don't carry over into a new event deck). In terms of rebuilding the event deck: we tend to set aside used events, and only build the deck with new 'fresh' events.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838292/enemy-ability-reference	Is there a list of enemy abilities and their descriptions? I can't seem to find anything in the rules.	Check the bottom of the Enemies entry at the Sleeping Gods rulebook page 35.	
	What are the implications of shuffling the Search Tokens each time players save/restore?	The order of Search Tokens, which normally are only shuffled when they run out, matters. Instructing players to reshuffle these tokens each time they save/restore could have gameplay implications, especially since the order is supposed to be significant.	
	What is the suggested house rule for handling market cards?	The suggestion is to create a market stack tied to the market at that location in the atlas instead of sending un-purchased cards to the bottom of the deck. This would allow players to return and purchase items they previously couldn't afford, giving each market a unique personality.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838085/is-it-a-totem-or-an-achievement-or-both	Is it a totem or an achievement or both?	The achievement paper has a list of totems and endings for you to track your progress through multiple campaigns and a list of unlockable cards on the bottom left of the sheet for cards you can use when you begin a new campaign once earned. But yes, most of the sheet is a list of totems.	
	Thank you, I don't think I explained my question very well though - on the left hand side it has a column that says 'achievements' then on the right there's a column that says 'totems' - if a card is in the achievement column is it a totem as well? Why is it not in the totem column? And additional question do you get all the cards in the achievement column for the new campaign or just the unlocks that you got from the totems and endings? And if it's not a totem and you don't start with the cards why is the column there and they're just not another adventure card? I don't understand what the achievement column is basically.	They aren’t two distinct columns, it’s just poorly organized headers. It’s more, Achievements/Totem List. Note that the list is alphabetical and continues from column to column.	
	So if I unlock a Totem, do I have the totem card when I start a new campaign? and if so, how do I know that when I gain a quest that would give me that totem card again? I would get nothing for my effort	No. Unlocked cards are different. Totem cards (and everything else except the special unlocked cards) go back into the deck. See the bottom of the achievement sheet. So if you have 4 totems at the end, you unlock quest cards 171 and 172. If on your next playthrough you find one or more totems again, they don't count double. So you would need at least 3 new totems crossed off (total 7+) to unlock cards 169 and 170.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2836975/does-everyone-have-the-keyword	Does everyone have the keyword?	The quest cards and adventure cards are shared resources. No one character holds them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2834346/command-tokens-in-combat	Can one player pay command tokens to boost another player's turn in combat?	The rules say you can spend command at any time (with a few specific exceptions) so I'm pretty sure that yes, you can.	
	You're probably talking about activating adventure cards that provide extra aim or shields? Yes, I believe you can pay command to activate that during another player's combat turn.	I don’t think so. Combat is way more restrictive on spending command on other players attacks and being attacked than other situations. And pooling command is also impossible.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2832316/order-of-play-after-first-event-shuffle	Order of play after first event shuffle	Yes, that's correct. Finish the current turn as normal by taking your two actions then continue as usual.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831931/experiencelevel-cards	Can u have as many level cards as u want in each character?	Yes. There is no limit on the number of level cards per character. Only limited by the experience you're able to gain.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831400/location-29-minor-spoiler	Does this mean I can sell four items of the same type (like 4 Status Tokens) or do I have to sell one item of different types (like 1 Material + 1 Artifact + 1 Food)?	yes, you can sell 4 of the same type.	
	Moreover, since I can’t find a rule that prevents you to explore the same location twice in one turn, is it possible to explore location 29 twice in the same turn in order to sell more than four items (obviously Status Tokens) for coins?	you can explore the same location twice on your turn, but each explore costs you 1 action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2828615/keyword-question-minor-spoilers	When you first explore 174, if you have keyword FOAM, do you go to a different paragraph?	Yes, if you have keyword FOAM, you go to a different paragraph.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	When do adventure cards become refreshed?	This does not happen automatically. Some of the ship actions (Bridge, Quarters) allows you to remove all/certain number of command tokes from the cards/player boards, making them ready to use again.	
	In which case, when are the command tokens removed?	You get to keep the adventure cards for the entire campaign; i.e.: the three rounds of event cards. Once your campaign is done and you have one of the endings, you reset the game, with the exception of any rewards you might get that carry over.	
	Is the campaign the default game mode?	Campaign is the only mode. You play until you reach an ending or are defeated. On brutal mode the defeat can come fairly quickly, on normal mode I would estimate it will take 5-10 hours to reach an ending point (based on my 2 campaigns YMMV), so unless you can keep it on the table the log is very useful. Also, don’t discount the value of the map on the back.	
	When it comes to note-taking how much do you write down?	You can use the journal log to record xp, to note how many times you have gone through the event deck, and you can use the map on the other side to note where you have been and wish to go. I also recommend listing the totems you find by number as you acquire them. It's helpful during the Game, as you will learn, to know how many you have.	
	Is there a different game mode in the Tides of Ruin expansion?	The Tides of Ruin expansion has an Arcade mode that allows players to play random generated journey rather than from the story book.	
	Is the map provided in the game searchable?	Note that this map (pdf file) is searchable. Makes it easy to figure out what page a location is in.	
	What happens on brutal mode if you are defeated?	Only on brutal mode that you ending the campaign when defeated. On easy / normal mode, you back to the port, lose some events, etc and continue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826357/question-about-activating-sofi-odessas-crew-abilit	Question about activating Sofi Odessa's crew abilities during combat	You did indeed play it wrong.The major misconception that I read in your post (though that may just be the wording)  is that the captain is shared among players. This is not the case. The captain is controlled solely by the active player. So she isn't shared but rotated. Also, giving command tokens to other players is not allowed.Note that it is allowed for other players to activate adventure cards on your turn. So in the situation above another player could have spent a command token to activate an adventure card giving you additional accuracy.	
	Am I right in thinking then that if one player has a glut of command tokens, they should just spend one to take someone else's combat action token just in case an ability like this could be useful?	Correct on both counts.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2821451/each-time-when-i-use-up-a-deck-of-event-cards-shou	Each time when I use up a deck of event cards should I return them to the box?	Read the text in the storybook. It will tell you exactly what to do after you've completed the relevant section. For example, at the end of story 1 (which you read after you've depleted the event deck for the first time) the story tells you to construct a new event deck from the event cards that were unused (so the ones left over after you assembled your first event-deck).	
	When I prepare the new deck should I randomly draw from the rest of 36 cards or from the 54 cards? And second time, should I just use the rest of 18 cards?	From the rest of the 36, and then use the remaining 18. When I finish each round of the event deck, I place those cards on the Completed Quests' box so that I don't mix them up until the end of the campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2820281/can-i-spend-command-in-the-middle-of-a-ship-action	Can I spend command in the middle of a ship action	I'm pretty sure you can. The rulebook says you can spend command at any time.  Yes, I believe you can... you can spend command between the different ship action tasks... just not in the middle of one of those tasks. Once you start removing command, you need to finish that part of the ship action. (So, you couldn't remove command, gain and spend command, then continue removing.) I'd say this more often comes into play if you have a full hand of cards. Then you might want to gain command, spend command to equip a card, then draw cards. (Because as soon as you draw over your hand limit, you must discard back to your hand limit before doing anything else.)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2819777/what-to-do-if-ship-has-all-but-1-damage-spot-left	What to do if ship has all but 1 damage spot left open?	If you cannot take an action because all rooms have 2 damage, move the ship action figure to one of the rooms, but take no ship action	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2819669/is-the-effect-of-recipe-or-other-adventure-cards-l	Is the effect of recipe or other adventure cards lasting?	All adventure cards require you to put a command on them to activate. So they're usable only once until you remove that command token (via a ship action).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2815126/exploration-question	When you explore, and you read a paragraph from the book, sometimes it's a challenge, so you have to choose one or more characters to participate and give them fatigue tokens. If there's negative effects, they get some and then you can give damage to the rest of the crew.Sometimes though there's no challenge connected to an attribute, just a choice to make, do I have to choose a character to participate again and give them fatigue tokens? In which case this character gets the negative effects /rewards?	For any challenge, you can choose to not have any crew members participate and simply move on to the draw fate step. Negative effects for failure are applied to participating crew members first (divide as you see fit). Any negative effects that can't be assigned to participating crew members then get applied to any eligible non-participating members (again, you choose how to divide amongst them).If there's no challenge, just a choice, then no crew members are participating in a challenge. No fatigue tokens are given. Assign any negative effects of the story to any eligible crew members.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2814313/hunting-serpent-card	The rules for this card (pg. 12) states that "as an action" you can fight it. Does this refer to one of the 2 Actions available at the end of your turn? Or is it a Challenge?	Yes, it is 1 of your 2 actions. So you would need to spend an action to attempt the challenge. This was confirmed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2813941/final-score-do-you-count-unlocked-quest-cards	Do you count unlocked Quest cards?	The rules say to count Adventure cards, it doesn't make exceptions for the starting cards or the campaign upgrades - so I just include them in the tally.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2810990/symbols-next-to-titles-in-storybook	Some have them, most don't.  What are they (if the answer isn't a spoiler of some kind)?	If it's what I'm thinking of, it indicates the author of that section. If you check the beginning of the Storybook, you should see that icon next to the writer's name.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2810718/challenge-and-crew-member-abilities	Hey, i have to clarify one thing before going on to play solo: I need to make a challenge and choose two of my crew members. They’ll get their fatigue tokens. I am able to activate one (or two, or three…) of my other crew members (not participating) „crew member ability“ right? Without getting a further fatigue token or paying a further command token (except the command token costs from the ability card.) Sorry if that was already answered somewhere else. I searched for it but didnt find the exact „setting“.	Abilities, yes, you can. (though I'm unsure which ability you would use in such circumstances, maybe some re-draw ability ? )	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809483/interupting-ship-actions	If I'm doing the ship action Bridge: can I take the Command, then spend it on an adventure card ability, then finish the Bridge action by returning the Command to the supply?	This interrupts the ship action, so no. After resolving everything for the chosen Ship action, you can spend Command before you go to Event phase.[Edit]: Though the way you played is supported by other players - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2607837/article/37080527#37080527	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809353/combat-token-placement	Combat token placement?	In the rules, players can give each other unused combat action tokens, but each time a combat token is given, one of the players (giving or receiving) must pay 1 command. This implies it's per round, not just once for the entire combat. If you don't have the command, then those tokens can't be used. Additionally, if Player A was the active player when the combat started, they can still place tokens on the Captain, unless the Captain is also at 0 health.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	Does this mean the crew members I control, or any member on the table?	Context is important, but it normally means the crew which one player controls. For example, Rulepop says: "If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped." Was there a specific use case or rulebook sentence to which you were referring?	
	Specifically Challenges and applying status tokens. It says "your", but since other players can contribute characters to a challenge by spending a command, I assume they can also be the target of a status token. Bigger question is if no characters participate in the challenge and a status token needs to be placed, can it go on another player's character?	Context is important, but it normally means the crew which one player controls. For example, Rulepop says: "If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped." Was there a specific use case or rulebook sentence to which you were referring?	
	Means, 2 of my available skills were not active? Which of them is chosen by me? Or are they depending on my current necessary skills like savvy in my actual challenge?	it means all skills count as 2 points lower when making a skill check.so if you had 3 savvy, it would only add +1, not +3 in a savvy check.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2805304/questions-about-adventure-cards-and-fights	But how long is the Cloak of Ulo active?	Adventure Cards are not 'active'. They provide no benefit until used. To activate the card, pay its Command cost, then apply the effect. The Cloak can be used to block 3 points of damage once by spending a Command point.	
	If we use Odessa two times in the same fight, does it continue to be active?	Each crew member can have up to 2 combat action tokens, so Odessa cannot be used 4 times in the same Combat round.	
	So the Cloak of Ulo only works as a one time block?	Yes, you spend the command token and activate the shield once. You can't activate it again until you remove the token.	
	On that same thought, like in combat does as much damage as possible have to be placed on a single character and any overflow all onto a single other character, etc.?	Yes, during combat all damage dealt by a single enemy attack (counterattack or end-of-round attack) must go to a single crew member. If doing that causes that crew member to get knocked out then the remaining damage must be applied to a single other character, repeating as necessary. See the "Counterattack" section here.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2802859/crew-board-abilities-question	Can you use a crew member's ability if they are knocked out by damage?	Unfortunately, no. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health (from the Sleeping Gods Rulepop reference). However, they can use their abilities during the action they are knocked out of battle. For example, if Mac misses during combat and is knocked out, she still attacks for one damage, and you can still use her ability to pay 2 command for one extra damage. But after you move on from this combat action and attack with someone else, you wouldn't be able to use any of her abilities.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2801274/can-fate-abilities-be-used-in-combat	Can fate abilities be used in combat?	I'm positive abilities that redraw fate cards can be used during both combat and challenges, though Kasumi's redraw fate ability is restricted to the player who controls her. Your example of Kasumi and Mac works, but your Kasumi couldn't help a character under someone else's control redraw.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2798520/using-non-active-audrie-to-travel-need-to-pay-1-co	If the active player decides to Travel, and the non-active player agrees to have Audrie participate in the craft challenge, does the non-active player need to pay 1 command, as would be the case in a normal (i.e., non-Travel) challenge?	Yes they would need to pay 1 command and place a fatigue on Audrie.	
	Let’s say I got an ability card with perception skill which gives you +2 accuracy (or +2 defense) when you discard it.If I’m playing with captain and I discard this equipped card to get +2 accuracy in combat, then can I get 1 plus damage as well? On the rule book it says ‘you may discard 1 equipped when you attack with this weapon’ but I’m not sure if it means I should discard the card when I’m dealing the damage or I can discard it anytime in a combat round. Also Am i allowed to discard equipped card more than 1 (2cards) at the same time?	You cannot discard a card for two things at the same time. If you discard your ability card for +2 accuracy, that's all you get. If you discard it to get +1 damage with the captain's rifle, that is all you get.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2797643/lukran-engine-rules-clarity	Can I pay 2 command to travel only 1 distance?	Yes. From the Travel rule entry: "For each distance you may move to 1 adjacent region."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2796381/do-ongoing-cards-leave-the-play-area-when-the-even	Do ongoing cards leave the play area when the event card deck runs out?	It depends on the card. Some of them will direct you to remove it when the deck runs out. Some won't. The cards will indicate when. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2795611/travel-clarification-can-you-split-travel	Are you allowed to split your travel action with an explore action?	Under travel it specifies "for each distance you may move to 1 adjacent region." You can always move less if you overshoot the CRAFT challenge score needed to travel to your destination, but it makes no allowance to bank extra movement. Unfortunately, you'd need an additional travel action after your exploration to do so.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794921/quest-clarification	Does this mean that Mac is unavailable, not on the ship, can’t help during combat, etc, until the crew goes to this cabin and gets her?	No, unless a quest or part of the storybook specifically says a character is unavailable then they are available. I've only run across one such case and it was very clear. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794525/question-about-splash-damage	On the rule book it says I can do splash damage as long as I deal half of damage to the monster that I targeted.So what does it mean half of damage?Is it the amount of damage (quantity of enemy’s heart) or just damage token that I’m supposed to put on the enemy card?	Good question.  I'd say it's the damage.  The rules say at least half of the damage must go on the targeted enemy - not 'half of the damage counters'.	
	Can I piggyback a question on this?  Can you place a counter on a "blank" space on the targeted enemy, to give you the half damage you need, to splash some to an adjacent enemy?	I can't think of any rule or reason why you can't. We've done that a few times in our encounters.	
	Can I piggyback a question on this?  Can you place a counter on a "blank" space on the targeted enemy, to give you the half damage you need, to splash some to an adjacent enemy?	Agreed! There could be times dealing regular damage that you cover blank spaces to reach critical spots you want to cover - the rules don't include any exceptions for splash damage, so as long as the damage is anywhere on the enemy, you are good to go!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2793408/can-level-cards-be-counted-as-skill	can level cards be counted as skill?	Yes, we definitely count them. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any reason for them to have skill icons.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2791576/counter-attack-and-block	Can any player pay for adventure cards?	Yes, any player can spend command to activate adventure cards to help themselves or the active player.	
	Are there any exceptions to which cards can be shared among players?	Yes, all players share ownership of adventure cards and can use them at any time, even to help another player. However, ability cards and crew board actions are exclusive to the specific crew member, except for Mac's +1 fate, which can be used to help another player.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2790265/end-of-event-deck-procedure	So, if you succeed, do not restore crew health, is that correct?	That's correct.	
	It also doesn't say anything about status effects, so do not remove status effects, correct?	Correct.	
	So in theory, instead of placing two fatigue tokens, I can just flip one over. I am just thinking to save space on the character boards.	Yes, but then you wouldn't be able to save your game, which is why the rules exist as they are. If you packed your crew boards away with all their tokens, then the next time you took them out you wouldn't know which side the token was supposed to be on. If there are two tokens, you quickly know how much fatigue your crew member has. But if you'd rather use a different method for saving, or if you're just leaving your game set up, that's totally fine. That's just the reasoning behind why the rules are the way they are.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2790072/bridge-action	Besides drawing ability card and gain command tokens, does the bridge action allow player to return all command tokens from any 1 of 9 crew, b. return 1 command tokens from all 9 crewc. return all command tokens from all 9 crew . do other (please specify)	All of the command tokens on all crew members and all adventure cards return to the supply, it's a full reset.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2787199/can-ability-cards-be-discarded-from-hand-voluntari	Can ability cards be discarded from hand (voluntarily without discard text)?	Discarding can be done only if you reach your hand limit, I think. In this case you would replace one of the 6 with the new ability card.Otherwise you have to make sure to use high number ability cards in the challenges.One of the ship actions allows you to discard an ability card from your hand to get rid of one fatigue.	
	Can ability cards be discarded from hand (voluntarily without discard text)?	As far as I can see, the only times you can discard ability cards are:1) Ship action in the Galley to remove 1 fatigue2) hand/card  symbols mean discard 1 card from your hand3) during a challenge, any players can discard cards from their hand to give a +1 each.4) any special story paragraphs that tell you to.5) discard excess cards over 3

I would argue that "activates at the end of each combat round" implies immediately at the end of the round. Any other interpretation is reading into the rules and is not focusing on exactly what the rules are saying. As a result, I believe any ability uncovered will activate in the round that Adjacent Regen applies.

	Are you sure?  I thought that Events happened BEFORE the Action phase and were separate?	Generally yes but this is an ongoing event that stays active until discarded and it needs an action for it to be discarded.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2777631/can-an-ability-card-be-equipped-during-a-ship-acti	Can an ability card be equipped during a ship action? Specifically after gaining command, but before gaining a new ability card?	YES, this is a valid play! The long answer is: there’s a combination of rules which covers you here. Rulepop says: Ship action effects can be applied in any order. Rulepop says: You must pay command to … equip ability cards to crew members. You may spend command at any time, even on other players’ turns. You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge. Which fits your scenario nicely. BTW, you may NOT draw a 4th card, decide to equip one of them, and keep the remaining 3. Rulepop says: If after drawing new Ability Cards your hand size has exceeded the limit, you must immediately discard down to 3 cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2776331/what-order-are-enemies-supposed-to-be-arranged	What order are enemies supposed to be arranged?	Shuffle the cards you just retrieved and place them face up in a row in the center of the table, without any space between cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2774095/status-token	Can you put a status token on a crew member that’s dead? Or exhausted already?	As far as I know yes, but remember that status tokens usually end up on characters who participated in challenges or combat, and if your character is totally exhausted or at zero health then they probably aren’t able to do that stuff in the first place.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2772410/do-crew-block-and-plus-1-damage-abilities-only-app	Do crew block and +1 damage abilities only apply to themselves, or to other crew?	There's a fantastic interactive Rulepop page. Under "Crew Board" it gives clarification for all of the innate abilities, and much more - but generally, combat related abilities (+1 damage, block, +1 accuracy) only apply to the member whose board it is. The general Fate and Condition-Removal ones can be applied to anyone.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2760432/does-monster-and-explorer-token-get-reset-if-you-v	Does monster and explorer token get reset if you visit the same place again?	I assume the damage is reset. It would be nearly impossible to track all of the health statuses of the monsters you nearly defeated around the map.	
	> Also, just to be sure, you do not gain additional damage by considering the symbols on the character, right ?	Thank you everyone!!!Yes i was doing it completly wrong!!! I was adding the simbols on the board, on the ability card equipped as well!!! It felt a bit too easy XDThank you again so much!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2752675/who-can-use-command-to-activate-shared-adventure-c	Who can use command to activate shared adventure cards during battle?	Rulebook P.29: "ANY player can use adventure cards you own at any time, even to help another player in a challenge or combat." For the avoidance of doubt, that's a "yes".	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2751983/adventure-card-damage-between-attack-and-counterat	can adventure cards that do damage be activated between the attack and counterattack of a combat. For example, monster has three health remaining. My attack does 2 damage. Can I or another player spend command to activate an adventure card for an extra damage to kill the monster before the counterattack occurs?	Yes. It's the same point at which you would use a character ability to supplement your damage / hit diagonals / discard skills. I haven't played in a minute, but we're talking bombs and poison, right? Makes thematic sense to play them as part of your 'full' attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2750800/when-can-people-spend-command-tokens-and-on-what	When can people spend command tokens and on what?	1) Any player can spend command at (basically) any point to play one of their own ability cards in front of any crew member's crew board. 2) Players can spend command tokens to activate their own crew board abilities for their own crew. They cannot spend command tokens on other players' crew boards. 3) Players can spend command tokens at any time to activate adventure cards. 4) Players can spend 1 command token to take a combat action token from another player or give a combat action token to another player.	
	What are the restrictions around spending command tokens on abilities attached to equipped ability cards?	Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card. Therefore, if the equipped Ability helps with a Challenge, that Crew must be participating in the Challenge to help. If an ability description says 'you,' it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped.	
	When/if the ability card deck is emptied, is the discard pile reshuffled into a new deck?	Yes, the discard pile is reshuffled into a new deck when you run out of cards. There isn’t anything in the rules that specifies to do it at a certain part of the game.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2739037/watchful-laurent-level-card	Can I only use the ability if I draw 4 tokens (3 plus the "extra")? Or can I draw 1 token and stop an then draw the "extra" one?	You can choose to draw only one token and use the ability to draw another ignoring the damage in it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738225/location-190-g-and-her-gcs-spoilers	When you complete a task for a passenger, what happens to the adventure card depicting them?	If the text said "Lose Adventure card X" you put it into the Used quests box. If the text said nothing, but the person has left thematically, either keep the card or house rule it and put it to the Used quests. You should never put a card back in the magnetic box.	
	Out of curiosity, was this quest acquired on a Tides of Ruin expansion map?	This quest is from the base game map.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2735968/official-solo-rules	One of the threads here mentioned the "Official Solo Rules".  I can't find anything similar anywhere. About the only thing I stumbled across was a discussion where someone preferred playing solo as if they were two players each with 4 crew. As far as I can tell playing solo just means starting with one command token and with a single hand of cards, still with a hand-size limit of three.. Are there any specific special solo rules?	Those are the official solo rules you mentioned. Some solitaire players prefer to play two-handed (or more) where you get more cards (overall) but have to use command to use the "other" players characters on "your" turn, and so on.	
	What is the main cost of repeated spaces like this?	The main cost of repeated spaces like this is just an opportunity cost. If you're taking extra turns to re-do that one spot for the rewards, then you're not spending turns exploring new locations which potentially might have higher numbers of rewards. But unless there's a keyword blocking you, you are allowed to repeat locations.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2728099/when-a-crew-member-loses-all-health	If a crew member loses all health, does he or she die?	No, you just can’t use them for combat or challenges until you heal them, I believe. They’re considered to be on the verge of losing consciousness. It’s in the rule book.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2727593/clarification-on-spolier-at-location-40	So, does everyone heal 6 damage, or is it 6 health in total, among the crew?	It's 6 total. You can tell the second part affects each crew member individually because it specifies ALL status tokens on ALL crew members. If there's nothing in the text that specifies, healing always applies across the whole crew and not per crew member.	
	And to be honest, I'm not sure what all the errata are.  Is there a link for the complete errata?	Not sure about complete, but here is the official documented errata:https://www.redravengames.com/sleeping-gods/#DocumentsAlso, they are using this rule site:https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2721403/synergy-tokens-on-a-miss	Say I attack with the captain who has another crewmember's +1 damage synergy token. I miss. Therefore, I take the counterattack from the monster and then normally am allowed to deal one damage. Can I use the synergy token to add damage, even though I missed?	Yes, you can. The rule says: "Missing: If you miss, you still get to deal 1 damage, after the enemy counterattack (you deal 0 damage in this case if you have 2 fatigue). Abilities that increase attack damage can be used even if you miss."You can check a particular rule quickly in this awesome online guide: https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#attack-counterattack	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2720124/how-do-you-place-combat-damage-on-enemies	How do you place combat damage on enemies?	You pick! Every new attack you place damage where you want to as long as it is not on top of or skipping previous damage, but all damage for that attack has to be placed adjacent and orthogonally. For that initial attack, you place it wherever. As said, the attack can start anywhere (on the enemy you targeted). One rule we forgot initially is that at least half of the damage (rounded up) need to be placed on the target enemy - limiting your splash damage potential. Also remember that cards giving you a standalone attack like Chloroform (or some passengers, etc.) are considered a standalone attack that does not have to be adjacent to anything. On the other hand, the "add 1 damage to attack" cards/synergies will just increase your normal attack and adjacency rules do apply.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2718140/healer-remove-status-token	When i go to the healer? Does the healer remove status tokens as well?	The healer just patches your wounds and heals you - unless instructed otherwise, status conditions persist until something tells you specifically to remove them (like character abilities, items, and a few other methods).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2711287/level-cards	Is there a limit to the number of level cards a character can have? Or can they, assuming you accumulate enough xp, get all of their level cards and benefit from them all at once?	There is no limit on Level Cards, only on Ability Cards. So, a character can end up with all of their Level Cards + 2 Ability Cards equipped.	
	Can any player spend command to activate an adventure card like Scoundrel's Gear to give +2 cunning during a challenge, or is only the active player allowed to do that?	Any player is allowed to spend command on Adventure Cards at any time, so we did allow any player to activate these during challenges.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2705777/can-you-explore-the-same-location-multiple-times	Can you explore the same location multiple times?	Yes, it's possible. Otherwise, you will receive a quest card including a word which would let you skip this action. You can explore as many times as you want, but each time is one of your actions. To limit abuse of this: You get only 1 resource on the "infinite" combos. (not worth the action unless you're desperate) Good rewards will be blocked with a "quest" keyword that sends you to a different paragraph without the rewards. While you are exploring one area that offers you multiple choices and bring you back to square 1 (typically: cities and villages), you can pick each option maximum 1 time. But if you go back to your boat and explore again the location, indeed you get to pick again an option you took before. Most locations give you a keyword (or make you lose a keyword) that makes it so the second and further times you explore that area you have a smaller exploration action. Typically you can get food or materials, or have a combat again (the tentacled beach on the first page is a good place to gain some experience and meat early in the game), but every time you take an action this way you're spending time that you are not using for exploration and totems-hunt.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2698111/market-price-discount-interaction	Is there a 'minimum' price in the market? That is, do the 1-cost items become free due to the discount, or are they a minimum of 1 coin each?	Card as written = the -1 cost makes the 1 coin items free.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2692555/crew-abilities	Does a crew member have to be participating in the challenge in order to use their crew ability?	You can spend command at any time, even on other players' turns. This includes spending it to activate crew board abilities to help in challenges (even if you’re not the active player). And you can use the crew board ability even if the crew member didn’t “participate” and gain fatigue in the previous step of the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690600/lose-food-but-no-food-unfulfilled-demand-eg-rotten	What happens when you are instructed to lose food but your supply is lower than the amount you are told to lose?	If you only have 1 food and you are told to lose 2 for example, you just lose 1 food. In the case of unfulfilled demand, like with Rotten Supplies, if you have no food, you can argue thematically that there was no fungus to begin with, so it's okay to throw out all 0 food.	
	With Rotten Supplies, if we have 0 food going in, are we allowed to "throw out 0 food" and carry on with no downsides?	Yes, thematically, if there's no food, there should have been no fungus on it in the first place, so it's okay to throw out all 0 food. However, the rulebook's differentiation between "pay/spend" and "lose" might not be explicitly stated, leading to some confusion.	
	From the Event rule section, what happens if you don't have two foods to discard for an ongoing event like Rotten Supplies?	If you don't have two foods, the rot continues. Thematically, there's always 'food' on the ship for the crew, and food resources represent extra stock/reserves. In such situations, it's suggested to always keep a bit of extra everything.	
	Are the two foods necessary to remove the card cumulative?	No, according to the ongoing rule, discarding 1 food on two different turns does not suffice to discard the card. You would have to pay the two foods in one single 'payment'.	
	What are the types of ongoing events?	There are essentially two types of ongoing events where you can either spend an action to do a challenge to get rid of them or do a challenge at the end of a turn. Rotten Supplies and Rats cards, while ongoing thematically, don't have the "ongoing" keyword, meaning the usual rules for ongoing events don't apply to them.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2688585/discarding-surprise-strike-when-equipped-to-kasumi	Would Discarding Surprise Strike while equipped to Kasumi when dealing damage allow for +2 damage?	No. From the rulebook (p.34): "Surprise Strike: Discard the card to deal 1 damage (no enemy counterattack.) You do not need to draw fate or use a combat action token to deal this damage."Surprise Strike does not add damage to an attack you're already making; it's a separate 1-damage attack. (That's why the card's damage icon has a '1' and not a '+1' like Rafael or Mac's board abilities.) You can discard it at any time to deal one damage, or you can discard the skill for its Cunning after a successful attack to add one to Kasumi's total damage - not both.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2687514/ability-cards-fate-and-abilitys-on-crew-members	Can I use the top ability of the crewmember board and an ability on a skill card which I add to this crew member or can I use e.g. both, the Skills and the Ability on the board?	You can use as many abilities of your Crew & all Adventure Cards as you can afford to pay Command for and which are not blocked.Crew Board Abilities and Adventure Cards retain Command when used.  While they are blocked with Command Token(s), they cannot be activated.  So each Crew can use one of their abilities once before they have to have that Command removed, then they can use any one of their abilities again.  The Ship Actions with the Command icon and curved arrow are used to return blocking Command to the supply, thus freeing Crew Boards and Adventure Card abilities to be reused. (There may be other ways but this is the most common route of getting Command off cards/boards and back into the supply.)Ability Cards attached to Crew do not retain Command.  Command spent to activate Ability Cards goes straight back into the supply. See (Rules, pg. 18) for more details on spending Command for abilities.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683876/challenges-step-3-can-you-use-abilities-on-chars-n	Can you use abilities on characters not participating?	Yes, abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card. However, the language on some cards, such as Mac's World Lore, suggests they can be used during any challenge, whether the crew member is participating or not. This interpretation allows for more flexibility in using abilities, especially for expensive level-up cards.	
	Do you only get to use abilities on equipped ability cards if you also participate by taking the fatigue?	No, participation is mainly for deciding which characters' skill icons you are adding to the fate card value. It also affects who takes damage from challenge failure penalties. However, abilities on equipped ability cards can often be used regardless of whether the character is participating in the challenge.	
	Is it legal to use Mac's World Lore ability without choosing anyone to participate in the challenge?	Yes, it is considered legal to use Mac's World Lore ability during any challenge, as long as Mac can still take damage. This does not require Mac or any other character to participate in the challenge, allowing for strategic flexibility.	
	Does the 'Redraw Fate if 1' ability on Kasumi's Crew Board apply only if the active player controls Kasumi?	No, the 'Redraw Fate if 1' ability does not strictly require the active player to control Kasumi. It is interpreted that the ability can be activated by the active player using command on Kasumi's card, allowing the active player to redraw fate. This interpretation is supported by a discussion in another thread, indicating flexibility in using crew board abilities even if the crew member didn’t participate in the previous step of the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2682748/defeat-and-status-removal	Any chance we remove status effects after character defeat, just like injuries and fatigue?	Unfortunately, no, unless you want to house rule it. https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#defeatFWIW, the further you get into the campaign, the more adventure cards you can collect to help you remove statuses, in addition to the crew abilities you start with.	
	Now that we're talking splash damage; do you place the enemy cards from left to right in numeric order at the beginning of combat, or do you get to choose how to place them?	Rulebook Pg.21-Combat Setup: "Retrieve the listed enemy cards from the enemy deck. The deck should be in order, face down. Look through the cards until you find the listed numbers. (Do not look at the fronts of the other cards in the deck, only the backs.) Shuffle the cards you just retrieved and place them face up in a row in the center of the table, without any space between cards."	
	What about crew board ability and equipped ability cards?	From the way the rulebook reads, you can equip an ability card to any crew member (even those of other players), but in order to activate crew abilities, the player that controls that crew member is the only one who can activate it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2678456/question-regarding-the-4-grey-combat-cubes	Is it possible for a player’s character, for example Mac, to have two grey combat cubes during a round of combat?	Yes, the restriction is that a character can't have more than 2 combat action tokens on them (i.e., you can't use Mac to attack 3 or 4 times in a round, but 0, 1, or 2 is perfectly fine): rules pg. 23 If a crew member already has 2 combat action tokens, they cannot attack again until the next combat round.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677902/extra-weapon-damage-limited-to-one-card	Does this mean you can ONLY discard one equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage?	Yes, the rules imply that you can only discard one equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage, as indicated by the specific mention of discarding '1 equipped savvy card' for the extra damage.	
	Or could you potentially discard two equipped savvy cards to deal +2 damage?	No, based on the rules, you are limited to discarding one card per attack for the extra damage, due to the specification of '1 equipped card'.	
	If it said 'you may discard an equipped card' rather than '1 equipped card', would the interpretation be different?	Yes, if it were phrased as 'you may discard an equipped card', it might suggest that more than one card could be discarded. However, the use of '1' indicates a limit to the number of cards that can be discarded for extra damage.	
	What is the limit of discarding cards for extra damage?	The limit is one card per attack for extra damage, specifically an equipped savvy card, not a card from hand, and it must be equipped to be discarded.	
	Can you discard cards from hand to gain the extra damage?	No, the rules clearly state that the card must be equipped to be eligible for discarding for extra damage, thus cards from hand cannot be discarded for this purpose.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677204/search-token-question	In the rule book it says to apply any damage you find when you use the deck. Does this also apply to the low morale token with the coin? Or do you only apply damage? 	Yes, the designer has confirmed that somewhere - all negative consequences of all revealed tokens are applied, including low morale.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2676516/can-you-assign-damage-to-any-character-from-a-end	Can you assign damage to any character from a end of round monster counterattack?	Counterattacks must be against the crew who attacked, but end of the round damage can be assigned to anyone. (RB page 24).	
	Can a active captain  pick who will get the hit from each monster?	If you play with a friend and are captain this turn, makes sure you assign damage to his crew. It is a coop game, so you should mutually decide where the damage goes. However, the active player does have the final word in case of a disagreement. All the damage has to go to the same crew member (until they reach zero health, in which case all the remainder goes to another crew, etc.), but statuses can be assigned elsewhere.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2674665/when-does-the-event-deck-reshuffle	When does the event deck "reshuffle"?	After the event deck runs out, it gets remade (reshuffled) as part of story progression. That happens twice!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2669829/who-exactly-is-involved-in-combat	Who exactly is involved in combat?	I believe that everyone can be involved in combat, but depending on the amount of players, you can only have a certain amount of combat tokens. 4 tokens (1 player), 2 tokens each (2 players), 2 tokens to active player and one each for others (3 players), and 1 each (4 players). I do believe that another player can pay a command to give another combat token to another player. Each player pays command for abilities on the crew board.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2669198/question-regarding-bold-attempt-ability-card	I assume this card has to be equipped, correct?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2668301/ongoing-events-and-reset-of-the-event-deck	Is there any reason to hope that my ongoing events go away after resetting the event deck? Or do I still have to deal with them?	The rules tell you how to handle this at the top of page 11. There should be instructions on the card to tell you how to get rid of it, or when the card expires.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2666818/protect-level-ability-card-rafael-one-time-or-mult	Can you use the 'Protect' level-ability card of Rafael only once per combat or multiple times?	Yes. The level cards are permanent and can be used repeatedly if the situation they apply to comes up and any associated cost is paid. They don't get blocked by command tokens like character board abilities do. As long as you keep sacrificing his health, Rafael can keep running in a circle, repeatedly intercepting face-punches as long as he is able.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2664014/how-many-times-can-a-crew-member-attack-in-one-com	How many times can a crew member attack in one combat round?	Yes, provided they use two combat action tokens.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2662467/where-to-put-status-gained-from-an-event-card	Where to put status gained from an Event Card?	If there is no challenge involved then it could go to any crew regardless of who controls them. If there was a challenge draw and one or more crew members were given a fatigue token, so as to add their skill bonuses, then the status is assigned to one of those crew members. however if there was a challenge and nobody was assigned to the draw, then it is free assignment once again. If there is more than one status or damage involved they do not have to go to the same crewmember unless they are the only one that participated.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661898/instant-effect-on-ability-cards	Some ability cards like 'Cleaning' have the craft skill symbol and an instant effect of removing one low morale. I assume 'instant effect' means that the effect triggers when equipped but then the card only serves as another craft skill symbol. Correct?	Correct	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661731/event-card-explanation	Can you help me understand this card? Can I instantly do the challenge and discard it? When you do the action, is the effect of the card active? I mean when I do the 6 savvy and I draw fate for the final result, should I gain -1 health and 1 weakened? Is this action replaces the one of the two actions I have to do on my turn?	You have to use one of the 2 actions every player gets each turn after the event phase. If challenge is failed, the second action can also be used for that. Until someone succeeds in that challenge, anytime you a fate card shows a 1, the crew suffer the effect listed. Remember that -1 Health and Weakened can go to different crew members, which is decided by the active player. You leave this card face up next to your shipboard and it remains in effect until then. You do not have to do it that specific turn. You can do it on a later turn as well, but will continue suffering the effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661332/can-i-use-multiples-of-a-crew-ability	Can I use multiples of a crew ability?	No, because on certain ability cards, you don't put the Command Token on the card, you just discard the token, that's why you can reuse the card. Whereas with crew abilities, you place the command token on the used ability, preventing you from using it again until it is removed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2660308/discarding-fate	When I drawn ability card for purely a fate check, do I add the card to my hand or discard it when done? I see nothing about discarding, but I’m not convinced I keep it either.	You discard it. Discard. I don’t think of it as drawing a card, but rather flipping the top card into the discard, like a die roll. That was my instinct as well, but I saw nothing saying to discard. Thanks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2660172/running-out-of-status-tokens	What should we do if instructed to gain a status, but all the matching tokens are already on your crew?	Because of the limited components rule, nothing happens: rules pg. 8 Limited ComponentsAll components are limited, which means that if you run out, you cannot gain or use more, with one exception: damage tokens. If you run out of damage tokens, use something else to keep track.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659771/when-is-the-middle-of-combat-for-ability-card-purp	When is "the Middle of Combat" for Ability Card Purposes?	It'd be nice if the enemies waited around until you made your selections ... I'd say once you determine that combat will occur, the prohibition begins. Someone may think differently, but that makes most sense to me.	
	When can I cook a recipe? In the middle of a noncombat challenge? In the middle of an exploration before making a choice? After reading text?	Any time, except during combat. “During combat” means any time after you’ve looked at the enemy cards and before they are defeated. If you see there is combat about to happen, the game rules allow you to eat before fighting (thematically, you ate the food before the fight started).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659537/list-of-ability-card-questions-and-answers	What is the intended design of World Wisdom?	Reveal the event card and read it, discard World Wisdom, ignore everything on the event card.	
	A crew member attacks, misses, then resolves damage first due to the Rapid Strike ability. During the damage resolution, I discard Rapid Strike to get +1 damage. Does the damage still get applied first?	Yes. Once you’re in the “apply damage” phase, you can use various abilities and discard cards, but it won’t modify what combat step you’re in.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659000/level-cards-and-challenges	When level cards are equipped to crew members, do these "count" as additional values when performing challenges? Like a level card with a savvy icon for Laurent - would that mean when performing a savvy challenge with Laurent I have +2 (+1 from his mat and +1 from the level card)?	Yes, level cards add to a character's skills for challenges, etc. The only thing you can't do with level cards is to discard them to power up other abilities, like you can with regular ability cards. Level cards, once equipped, are permanent - but don't count against the "limit" of 2 ability cards per character. Challenges become significantly easier as you progress.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2658768/hunting-serpent-action	To get rid of the Serpent, it says: "Action: Perform a Strength 7 Challenge (...)" Does this mean this takes a full actual 'Action', i.e. replacing one usual action amongst the 'Travel/Explore/Market/Harbour'?	Yes. This is what makes it a real pain to deal with	
	Has this been confirmed somewhere by the designer? It makes sense in theory, but the rules don't say anything about your 2 turn "actions" being open to anything other than the 4 ones on the ship board.	Yes, any event card that has the word "action" on it requires you to use one of your actions to resolve it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648879/question-about-story-1-spoiler-for-going-through-f	Normally, when you are defeated you mark a defeat, remove all damage and go to the nearest port.What happens after you fail story one, except remove all damage? Do you also mark a defeat and move to port?	Yes, you do the same thing. You do not have to repeat 1 or 1.1, but just move on with the campaign. Don't forget to discard the top 6 cards of the newly formed deck. Or rather do not even bother adding the 6 easy events to the top.	
	When it says restore health, that does include status tokens?	No it does not. When you restore all health, you do not remove fatigue or status tokens unless specifically instructed to do so.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	When the rulebook says "any crew member" (e.g. removing Fatigue in the Galley, removing damage in the Sick Bay), should I assume it always means "even crewmembers controlled by another player", unless specified? Or are there any big exceptions to this?	Yes.  "Any Crew" means any of the crew, including the Captain and crew controlled by other players.	
	For example, can I buy weapons and equip them to crewmembers I don't control? What about the Inn? does it heal all crewmembers, or just the ones I control? etc.	Yes, you can equip weapons to any crew, at any time*, and they can be moved between crew members (your own or other player's).  The Inn heals all crew, not just the ones you control.*except during combat. (Rule Book, pg.29)	
	Can I spend Command tokens on things such as Adventure cards in the middle of resolving a Ship Action? For example, when performing the Bridge Action - can I draw my ability card from it, use Gloria to draw two more, THEN perform the rest of the Bridge Action, removing the command token from Gloria?	Yes.  Each part of a Ship Action (draw cards, heal, gain Command, etc.) is discrete, and other things can be done in between.	
	"Travel Example 3" seems to indicate that you can move off the edge of a page as long as you're at an edge with a numbered blue arrow - fair enough. You don't have to be in the actual region that contains the arrow, just in one of the regions of that edge. Is this interpretation correct?	Yes, this is correct.  You enter on the page listed on the arrow, in any of the region(s) on the opposite edge from the direction you departed, captain's choice. (Rule Book, pg. 13)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2643658/fatigue-and-fatigue-tokens	If i gain 1 fatigue, i take one fatigue token with the blank side up. If i gain second fatigue i flip my already blank token. From now on does this count that i have two fatigue tokens, so i can no longer participate in challenges? Or does the rulebook means "two physical cardboard tokens", so 1 flipped, and 1 blank (3 fatigue) and then i cannot participate in challenges?	You take a second token, flipped. When you remove 1 fatigue, you remove 1 token (the flipped one first). Having 2 tokens also reminds you of your character's fatigue level when you need to pack the game away and bring it out another day.	
	Is this true? If my crew is at max fatigue, the ability bonuses to challenges are essentially free?	No... You can't ever use a crew member who has two fatigue in a challenge (except for the Captain with her level card). What Fire_Forever meant is that if the action result gives you fatigue (i.e. as a consequence of success/failure), you can ignore that.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2641030/order-of-ship-actions-details	Can you equip an ability card with gained command and then take a new card?	Yes. Ship action 'effects' (gain command, gain card(s), heal, gain resource(s), etc.) are separate and can be done in any order desired. (Rule Book, pg. 10)  Other 'any time' actions like using Adventure cards can also be done in between parts of the chosen Ship Action. (Rule Book, pg. 16 & 29)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2641023/defaeted-enemies-are-they-removed-can-they-regen	Defeated enemies, are they removed, can they regen?	Yes, you remove the defeated enemy and slide the other two together. So enemy 3 would heal enemy 1, which would have become adjacent. And yes, when you kill an enemy it won't counter-attack!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640957/finished-game-question-on-campaign-unlocked-cards	For future campaigns, does this mean I unlock all the Quest cards before 15...? So in this table, do I get only cards 176-177, or am I able to get all cards listed below 16...?	You add up unique totems and endings you got and unlock everything up to and including that number. Don't miss the card 179 since you take cards from 178 to 180 once you reach #18.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640098/cooking-questions	With Alzarrian Cook Book, would I be able to use cake for 1 command and no grain, to remove 2 low morale and remove 2 fatigue?	Yes.	
	What does ‘while exploring’ mean in Outdoor Cooking Set?	I'd say just when using the Explore action and before 'Return to Ship'.	
	By having these 3 items, does it mean that by one command I can use Cook Book, and without using grain, cure 2 hearts and remove 2 low morale, 2 fatigue? Likewise use Spicy Gumbo, for any 2 food, to cure 5 hearts and remove 3 fatigue?	The cook book can only be used once per turn using any one recipe. Next turn you can clear the command and use it again. You can still use another command and use the same recipe on the same turn if you want, but using the full food requirement.	
	For 1 command and no ingredients, I can remove 1 fatigue and cure 4 hearts! Is this so...? And, can these be done on any character or it needs to be on one character?	Yes, that is all basically correct!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2639686/location-122	Can you only enter from page 16?	Yes, you can only enter from page 16, but it doesn't need to be from the upper left corner. Anytime you follow the arrow to another page, you can enter from any region on that side of the page.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2638251/unlocking-cards	When you unlock cards at the end of a campaign, do you count all totems from previous playthroughs or just the ones in the playthrough you just completed?	You mark the achievement sheet, and count everything. That way you don’t count any totums you’ve found twice.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2634456/inactive-player-using-crew-abilities	During a challenge can inactive players use crew abilities; even if they did not spend a command token to allow their crew to participate originally?	No. If you look at the crew abilities explanation detail on the official rules faq it specifically states you cannot use certain crew abilities on other crew mates unless specifically stated. For example, you cannot add combat values to other crew members but you can cure status ailments or redraw fate or repair the ship etc.	
	Is there one crew ability you can use on other crew mates?	Yes, the 'remove status' ability can be used on other crew mates. You can find the full explanation here https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/	
	Can you use combat abilities or Kasumi's +1 fate ability to help other crew members?	No. You cannot use combat abilities (+ to accuracy, damage, and block) to help other crew members and you can't use Kasumi's +1 fate ability unless she is involved. However, all the remove status abilities, Mac's redraw fate ability, and many others can be used to benefit any player and any crew member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2632694/activating-another-player-s-crew-ability-with-my-c	Activating another player’s crew ability with my command?	Each player can only activate their own crew members, and must use their personal command tokens for this (the activate player can also use captain Sofi). A player should plan to have some command tokens leftover at the end of their turn if they would like to have that option during other players' turns.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2628956/revisiting-sites-and-totems-in-a-new-campaign	If the Storybook tells you (for example) that in the future you are allowed access to the village and villagers whenever you wish, would that apply to a new Campaign as well?	No	
	Are you allowed to search for a Totem you found in a previous Campaign if its ability is worth going after (assuming you obtain the correct keyword first)?	Yes	
	Are you allowed to keep anything from your old Campaign after it has been completed successfully (other than the earned Endings) when you are ready to start a new Campaign?	No	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2628862/can-a-character-have-more-than-one-level-card-equi	Can a character have more than one level card equipped?	Yes. The rules kind of dance around stating it outright, but mention that level cards don't count towards the 2 card limit that ability cards have (page 17). It mentions "not including any level cards or weapons the crew member has)". You can equip every level card a crew member has at the same time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2626309/exploring-towns	Are you allowed to read all the choices before you decide which one(s) you wish to select?	Yes you can read all the choices and no you don't have to do then in any order. But you can't repeat any on the same turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2625329/event-deck-depletion-spoilers	When an event Deck is depleted and it's the next person's turn, instead of drawing an event card, you turn to entry 1 in the storybook. Does that person first get to take a ship action?	You complete that person's turn then turn to entry 1. After completing the actions of entry 1, it is the next player's turn.	
	Is the sequence of completing a person's turn then turning to entry 1 stated anywhere in the rulebook?	Rulebook page 12 second 'box'. After the heading 'First Time': "After you have drawn all the cards from the event deck, first the current players turn."	
	How is the gameplay sequence after the event deck is depleted?	You play the first 18 turns as normal (18 ship actions + 36 player actions). Currently, the deck will be empty during the player actions on the 18th turn. Then the 19th turn starts and that player does their ship action, they go to event phase and deck is empty, so you read 1. After resolving 1, that player then does their 2 player actions. The 20th turn is when the next event card would be drawn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623766/crew-abilities-abilities-redraw-fate-if-1	Can the non-active player use crew abilities on the crew members he controls to help out the active player?	The non-active player can help out by activating some of their Crew Board abilities, but not others. Only select Crew Board abilities can help other players/crew members; certain Crew Board abilities can only be used to affect that specific crew member.	
	During the active player's turn, could the non-active player use command-activated effects of ability cards equipped by his crew members?	Yes they can, but it depends on the language of the ability card on whether it can help the other player, or another crew-member.	
	Can a player use the Redraw Fate if 1 crew ability if he is the non-active player and the active player draws a fate 1 card?	No. 'You' always refers to the player who controls the crew member who has that ability. Also, as a clarification, there are times the non-active player may be able to use this. In Combat, the non-active player is still drawing fate for their attacks, and thus can use this Crew Board ability then to redraw fate on one of their attacks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623697/are-status-tokens-limited	Are status tokens limited?	Yes. All tokens are limited except damage tokens. There are only 4 of each status token except low morale, so if you have 4 of your crew weakened, for example, then nobody else can become weakened until someone is cured. Updated rule book page 8.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623692/spoiler-adventure-card-137	The card (Fish Bone Spear) is a weapon. Unlike the other weapon cards, it is not mentioned on it the word 'Weapon'. Probably because it is also a totem. Should I still equip it to a crew member the moment I get it?Thanks.	Yes. There are several totems that are also weapons.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623494/quests-12-and-coins	Aside from the introductory game, i.e. in the future campaigns - are we meant to start the campaign with Quests 1 and 2 as well?	Yes, you should start with them.	
	Is there any official denomination for what the bigger coins stand for?	The coins are 5's.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2622592/playable-with-5-players	Playable with 5 players?	The ship actions are balanced for 1-4 players, but you could have a fifth player serve as game manager without any trouble.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2620751/rotten-supplies-event-card	Does this ability stack? Every time we cook do we flip 2 fate cards?	Yes, I think you definitely need to do it twice. Otherwise the second card has no effect, in which case why would they have included two of them in the event deck? That’s the way I’ve been playing it, anyway. I can’t see any reason why you *wouldn’t* do it twice.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2619309/redraw-fate-question	Can I use command to redraw fate (on the Gear adventure card for example) on another players skill check / attack? If they were out of command for instance. We have been playing that you can't and I'm not 100%. I guess the same question for a characters (Kasumi's) crew board? Can her re-draw fate ability be used on another players turn?	The rules say you can spend command at any time, even on another player's turn. There are certain exceptions but this is not listed as one as far as I can tell from a quick scan of the spending command section. Command is supposed to represent the crew's mental and physical readiness and their ability to work together so if non-active players have the command to spend then it's fine.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2619010/defense-symbol-on-adventure-cards-question	what does a defense symbol on an adventure card mean? Can I spend that card's command cost when one of my crewmates is being hit to negate that much damage?	Yes. Actually, when anybody's crewmate is being hit I believe. With added benefit of being able to use this block for end of round attacks as well. Normal block found on weapons cannot be used this way.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618969/can-you-discard-an-adventure-card	Can you discard an adventure card?	Yeah I’ve come across a couple of these - once it did say to put the card back, and once it didn’t. I think the lack of instruction to lose that card is probably just an oversight. There's also an adventure card errata that confirms this for the only example of this that I have seen (or seen talked about).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	If you want to do splash damage against an enemy with resist, does that resist apply?	Yes, damage resistance applies whether the enemy is the primary target or receiving splash damage. Defense is ignored, and counter attack doesn't trigger, but other defensive abilities still modify the damage as it states whenever 'damage is dealt'. So, you'd need to do 2 splash damage to cover 1 space in this instance.	
	Can you discard two matching equipped ability cards for two extra damage?	No, you can only discard 1 equipped matching-icon ability card for +1 damage each attack. You can't discard 2 cards for +2 damage via weapon ability, but you can discard them sequentially for +1 damage on two separate attacks.	
	Can you use a card's ability and then also discard it for an additional effect?	Yes, it was clarified that you could use a card's ability, and then also discard it for an additional effect. For example, with Adrenaline, it could give you +1 damage if you have taken 3 or more damage, and you could then discard it for the icon to get an additional +1 damage if using a matching weapon for a total of 5.	
	Does the rulebook allow discarding two cards for two extra damage?	The rulebook (version 3.1) indicates you may discard 1 equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage, suggesting you cannot discard two cards for two extra damage. It seems to be a one-time effect per attack, not a 'per discard' effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2617834/miss-damage-against-flying-enemies-with-non-ranged	Do you do any damage when you miss a flying enemy with a non-ranged weapon?	Yes. Your accuracy is reduced, but not your damage. If you have 2 fatigue tokens though, that crew will do zero damage on a miss.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2615417/does-an-attack-by-a-crew-member-with-one-fatigue-r	Simply when does that second fatigue token take effect, on the second attack or after the second attack? IOW does the second attack result in a -1 damage or every attack after that second attack?	Fatigue occurs after the attack is resolved, so unless you have an item/adventure card that removes fatigue, you can get a maximum of 2 attacks with "fatigue" weapons...after which, any normal weapon attacks will be at -1 damage because of exhaustion.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2615332/clarification-on-accuracy-crew-ability	when you utilize Laurent's ability to increase his accuracy how long does it last?	Yes, it only lasts for one combat check, and it can only be used when Laurent attacks. You can activate it after drawing fate though... so it's typically emergency use when you need one more point of accuracy to hit.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611947/question-regarding-audries-distract-ability	Does a dead enemy still count as adjacent?	Dead enemies are removed and the gaps closed as soon as you kill said enemy.	
			
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611685/are-market-cards-treated-as-adventure-cards-in-eve	Are "Market Cards" treated as "Adventure Cards" in every way?	Yes they do count as adventure cards for scoring. You are only competing with yourself, so if you want to pad your score in any legitimate way then go for it.	
	In calculating the "Final Score" is says: Gain 2 points per adventure card. We did not count our plethora of Market Cards in our final score, as they were not labeled as "Adventure Cards." Should they count?	There are 4 starting cards in the market deck. Yes they do count as adventure cards for scoring.	
	Can buying cheaper Market Cards instead of more expensive ones affect my final score?	Buying cheaper cards does not gain you more points unless they cost 1. If you mean buying cheaper cards rather than better cards, that is up to you. Weapons are expensive, but are totally worth it. More expensive recipes are usually more efficient than the cheaper ones. There are many exceptions, but typically the more expensive market cards provide better use of your command points.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611195/end-of-round-can-all-monsters-attack-the-same-char	What about the armour with block that you can buy - does that affect all attacks?	Yes as per page 24, you can apply block from adventure cards, crew abilities or block that applies 'end of round enemy attack'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2610851/bandage	How does the bandage ability card work? Do you just use it any time and discard? Or can you use it an unlimited number of times?	It's an Instant Effect. Rule Book pg. 34, "General Ability Card Rules" - Instant Effect: Apply the effect the moment that you equip the ability card. As it doesn't have a cost, I would presume these are one time triggers. After that the card is effectively blank. The special ability is used up, as others posted above, but you still keep it attached for the skill bonus until you discard the card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2610743/first-strike	What does "first strike," mean on an enemy and where is this in the rulebook?	Rule Book pg. 35, "First Strike"This ability is active until disabled. Any time a crew member attacks this enemy, the enemy counterattacks first.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609514/event-card-question	When you go through the Event Card deck for the first time, and after taking the step indicated, you replace the Event Card deck, right? When you do that, do you retrieve all the event cards from the box, reshuffle, and pick 6-6-6 per the rules? Or do you use the same 18 cards for the second and third runthroughs?	you construct a new one, from new cards that weren't originally in play	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609108/where-do-search-icons-come-from	Where do "Search" icons come from?	Search is a ship action. Station 2. You play a game of chicken with yourself and turn over between 1 and 3 tokens. You get to keep the reward from only 1 token, but you take ship damage (and lost morale, and maybe other stuff I'm forgetting) from every token you draw. The binoculars allow you to ignore one damage per point of YOUR perception from Search Tokens you've drawn in the above mini-game.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609072/lose-quest-vs-discard-quest	I lost a quest. Based on my choices we chose a different path and didn't complete it. I was told "lose quest XX". Does this quest go in the discard box or back in the deck of quest cards? If it goes in the discard box, I'll get a point for it at the end of the campaign which seems off, but if I put it back in the deck could I possibly regain that quest?	When the storybook says “Lose quest x,” or “Complete quest x,” place the specified card in the used quest box. Once quests are in this box, you cannot retrieve them (unless you are reseting the game for a new campaign).	
	But if I did not accomplished the quest, why should it add points to my score at the end?		
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2608452/when-you-cook-a-recipe-ability-card-clarification	If the active player, who controls said character, pays 1 COMMAND on "Flapjacks" (it's a starting card), will I get the bonus included under that power?	I think this is clarified in the rulebook that the "YOU" is always referring to the active player - so Option #1 is correct, assuming the active player/controller are both you, which sounds like it is based on your wording. If you are playing solo - you are always the owner and active player so you will always get the bonus when cooking a recipe.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2607839/captains-synergy-token	Does the captains synergy token let you place all damage for that attack diagonally or just 1 damage diagonally?	The way it's written, I would say any/all damage.  It doesn't say a damage, or one damage.  Just damage."When activated, the crew member may place damage diagonally." (Rule Book, pg. 25)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606938/fishing-ability-card	How does this card work? It is an ability card that says, "When you use the Deck, draw fate, if 4+, gain 1 meat." Does this mean if I use gloria for 2 ability cards, I use this for each draw? Do I draw 2 everytime I use the deck whether it be for a draw, challenge, or combat?	The Deck is a ship action space, used to draw search tokens. When you use that ship action, you draw a fate card, and gain 1 meat when you get a 4+.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606614/ability-clarifications-not-so-clear	Is the "General Crew Board Ability Rules" section only for crew board abilities, or does it apply to Ability Cards abilities as well?	Ability cards generally follow the same rules as general crew board abilities, assuming it is not otherwise specified.	
	If Crew Board Ability Rules don't apply to Ability Cards, then can you use cards like "Treat" to remove status from other characters?	Yes, you can use cards like "Treat" to remove status from other characters, as abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.	
	Does this mean that cards like Bold Attempt that allow Fate Redraw can only be used when that character it is equipped on draws fate, or can it be used when any character or player draws fate?	Bold Attempt, Discard to redraw fate, can be done for any player's fate draw any time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606321/adventure-card-38-spoilers	With the Gate Stone (Adventure Card 38), it says “Move to Any Port”.  Does this include any port in the game including ports that I have not visited yet?	We were pretty sure it meant you could go to any port on the map, but decided to play it that we could go only to ports we've been to (either in this or past campaigns). No real reason for the restriction except we actually wanted to slow ourselves down, oddly enough. With so much to explore we didn't want to just zip around skipping all the fun stuff in between. But now that we achieved our first ending, I can see how down the line you'd want to teleport all over the place when looking to collect/accomplish particular things.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606175/story-1-first-time-through-event-deck-spoilers	So why do we need to discard our ability cards?	The ability cards represent temporary bonuses gained by training and preparing. They are not long-term skills and are meant to be discarded to allow players to make decisions about what abilities to equip for the entire run of the campaign.	
	Why does our crew get weaker?	The crew gets weaker because the ability cards, which provide temporary bonuses, are discarded after certain events, reflecting the loss of these temporary boosts.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606098/search-token-definition	The search token with a coin and a low morale. Do you gain or lose the morale. I assume gain, but then why would you ever select that one?	You get the low morale status even if you don’t select that token. Ryan clarified that it’s the same as damage, you take it immediately when revealed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605775/synergy-tokens	Do synergy tokens stay on character cards after the combat in which they were placed?	No.Pg 25 of the main rulebook, "At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member's synergy token is on the matching crew board." It goes on to clarify that outside of combat the tokens don't even need to be on crew boards and can be set aside.	"At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member's synergy token is on the matching crew board."
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605658/multiple-keywords-for-an-explore	During an explore action, the excerpt said "if keyword X turn to entry Y" AND "if keyword Z turn to entry V"...we have both keywords...do we get to choose which keyword we want to turn to, or is it first keyword listed takes priority?	Since you read from top to bottom, I always thought of it as go to the 1st keyword first. Then if you revisit, go to the 2nd keyword. So you're going in order. It makes sense since if you have no keywords, you follow the rest of the entry.	
	Shoot! We played it where we could pick which keyword we wanted to use, since we had both (and the one seemed bad). But hindsight, that does make sense to start from top down. Ugh, well now I feel like we missed out on something or altered the game...we are a few turns after that explore action and seems it'll be a hassle to revert back. Think it'll be okay to go forward, or should we revert back?	Just move on. Mistakes will happen. It's not worth backtracking more than one turn. You will know for the future.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605333/enemy-end-of-round-damage	Which of these statements is correct:A) Since all the damage must go to one crew member, I could choose Audrie, apply 1 damage token and ignore the rest. (I know this isn't correct but it is a logical possibility from the wording above).B) I assign one damage to Audrie and give 6 damage to Rafael.C) I am forced to choose Rafael because only he has the capacity to absorb 7 damage tokens (since all damage must be assigned to a single crew member).I think that (B) is the correct answer but I want to make sure my interpretation is correct.	B) is correctThis is stated clearly on page 24 of the most recent rules, found on RRG website.  It’s the last bullet in the same section of that same page.“If a crew member runs out of health while taking damage, any remaining damage must be dealt to another crew member, and so on.”(...it chains if a lot of damage is dealt).	
	Which of these statements is correct:A) Since all the damage must go to one crew member, I could choose Audrie, apply 1 damage token and ignore the rest. (I know this isn't correct but it is a logical possibility from the wording above).B) I assign one damage to Audrie and give 6 damage to Rafael.C) I am forced to choose Rafael because only he has the capacity to absorb 7 damage tokens (since all damage must be assigned to a single crew member).I think that (B) is the correct answer but I want to make sure my interpretation is correct.	B would be my vote. In short, all damage must be assigned to one character, but you can choose that character at your discretion. If any damage flows over, it must all be applied to another source of your choosing, repeat as necessary. What you cannot do is distribute remaining damage among characters to lessen the impact (e.g. no dividing 5 damage amongst a healthy crew).	
	For the end of round damage, it's the active player that assigns damage and can assign it to any crew member, including other player's crew members - does that sound correct?	This is correct. At the end of round the active player chooses to which crew member, including other player's crew members, will receive the damage.Note that this is different from a counter attack. After a counter attack, the attacking crew member will receive the damage and only if this crew members maxes out on health the active player chooses which other crew member will receive the remaining damage. See page 23 (5).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604720/enemy-cards-clarification	Why is the body empty? Does that mean I can still put a damage on there in order to get to an adjacent spot?	The body is empty because damage must be applied in a continuous "swipe," so it makes it more difficult to swipe those effects away. You're allowed to place markers in the blanks, they're just effort/damage sinks, in a manner of speaking. Game mechanics wise, it's empty to present a puzzle of how to mark off all the hearts. Canonically, the explanation might be something like this enemy's body isn't an important part to incapacitate them. Yes, you can put a damage in any box, even if empty, and may have to when trying to reach other more important boxes.	
	Is it okay to put damage on a totally empty spot (without a caption) or is that against the rules?	It's perfectly ok to put damage on an empty spot. Yes, not just allowed but often necessary.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604443/question-about-dungeons-solo	Added the Dungeons into the mix with my 3rd campaign, like them a lot, just to clarify there are 3 actions:1. Move2. Explore3. CampEach player gets 3 actions, so when playing solo it seems like there is no reason to break it down to 3 actions per round since the rules do not say that the actions have to be different.  Thus just move and explore until the characters need a rest and then camp.Hope I was playing this correctly.	Yeah, I don't think there's any reason to keep track of sets of 3 actions when you're playing solo. It seems like a way to get all players involved during multiplayer so it isn't just the player who took the initial explore action to enter the dungeon making all of the decisions.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2602921/is-command-limited	Is command limited?	Yes, command is limited. Edit: Page 8, "Limited Components" has the answer. Everything is limited, except damage tokens.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2602913/activating-an-adventure-card-when-no-character-par	Say for example I chose not to fatigue a character for a perception skill test of 6 and draw a 5 fate card. Am I allowed to activate an adventure card (like Bigfoot the Dog) to gain that final perception and pass the test?	Yes, absolutely, it's a great way to raise your chances of succeeding without unnecessarily exhausting a character.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601437/a-smattering-of-post-play-questions-search-tokens	How much of the fail/success criteria of an option should be read before making a decision?	You absolutely do read success/fail text before making your decisions, knowing the consequences of failure is important information for deciding how much to invest in a challenge.	
	In the case of needing coins for a trade, how many coins do you need to choose the option?	You only need 1 coin to use that option, you don't need extra to cover possible failure consequences.	
	Are you allowed to read ahead before making a choice in the game?	The rules explicitly say you cannot read ahead before making a choice, so you cannot factor in future costs.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601453/resolution-of-event-cards	Just learning the game and going through the walkthrough. I drew the event card ‘Maintenance’ which would allow to repair 1 ship damage. In such a case as not having damage is it okay to bypass resolving the event? This makes me wonder if other cards would have similar situations where they would make no difference if you were to attempt it. Can you ignore cards in such circumstances?	If an event card has only one challenge listed, you cannot skip it. You'd just not get a reward in this case.(updated rulebook, version 3.1)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601437/a-smattering-of-post-play-questions-search-tokens	Can combat abilities, like +1 accuracy or damage, ONLY be used if the character whose board they're on is the active combat participant, or can you spend command tokens to bolster others?	Page 34 clarifies this "Ability Clarifications." Bonuses to accuracy, block, and damage are only for that crew member. Others can be used on any crew member even if the crew member with the ability is not being used directly.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601294/questions-combat-and-ship-action	Can I run away if I'm doomed?	You can never run away (unless the story book explicitly gives that option somewhere).	
	If I choose to, can I cycle between the same 2 ship locations turn after turn (provided, of course, the locations aren't fully damaged)?	Yes.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	What if you can't place the last attack damage?	I would definitely cover one of them and the rest is wasted damage.	
	When dealing splash damage, if you do 2 damage to a 2 heart, can you then put 2 damage (across two boxes) to another enemy?	Damage dealt. So yes, you could do 2 damage to a 2 heart (covering only one box), and then put 2 damage (across two boxes) as splash damage to another enemy.	
	A crew member attacks, and just barely hits because of the Sharp Eye ability (+1 accuracy). While resolving damage, I discard Sharp Eye for +1 damage, but now the attack wouldn’t hit. Does damage still occur?	Yes. Once you’re in the “apply damage” phase, you can use various abilities and discard cards, but it won’t modify what combat step you’re in.	
	Overwork ability (once per turn, gain 1 low morale to redraw fate): does the low morale need to go on the crew with the Overwork ability?	No, it can go on any crew member. If you don’t actually gain any Low Morale (because they’re all in play), then you can’t redraw fate.	
	There’s an ability Power Strike (perception) that is different from Power Strike (strength). For the perception version of the ability, it says you can pay 1 command to get +1 damage when this crew member hits. How does it work?	Since command spent for abilities goes back to the supply, you can use this multiple times in the same combat if that crew member hits a monster multiple times, assuming you have enough command to spend. But, you can still only spend one command per hit (and only if you hit).	
	The Refine ability lets me spend 1 command to repair the ship. Since I don’t put spent command on ability cards, I can always repair the ship as much as I want, at any time, as long as I have 1 command to spend. Is that right?	Right. There are intentionally several ways for players to repair ship damage. Remember you must discard all your played ability cards each time through the event deck.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598795/what-rooms-for-ship-damage	What rooms for ship damage?	When instructed to take ship damage, draw 1 ability card per damage, then place a cube on the room(s) with a matching fate number. Each ship room can only take 2 damage and the hull can take 1 damage. If a room already has 2 damage, you may choose where to place the damage.	
	When you spend command to activate an ability card, where does that token go?	When you spend command to activate an ability card, that token does not go on the card but directly back to the supply. That means that as long as that character's player has command points, they can keep activating that card.	
	How is ship damage determined?	When Manticore takes damage, you draw a fate card to determine location for each point of damage, not each instance of damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598711/can-you-use-recipes-in-combat	Can you use Recipes in Combat	There is an explicit rule preventing this. Page 18 under activate adventure cards: While in combat, you cannot cook recipes or activate adventure cards that allow you to move the ship.	
	Can you however cook right before combat. So a combat is happening, but you haven't started it yet. Can you cook then?	Yes, you can cook right before combat (or right after), just not during. Again page 18, "You can, however, cook recipes in the middle of an explore action." Page 17, bolded "You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge." So as long as you're not in the middle of either of those activities, you can add a new ability card to a crew member.	Again page 18, "You can, however, cook recipes in the middle of an explore action." Page 17, bolded "You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge."
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598070/refine-ability-card	The Refine ability let’s you spend a command to repair a ship damage. Can you do this as many times as you want? Or once per turn? Or does the command go on the ability card and then get cleared similar to adventure cards?	Spending command on ability cards goes back to the supply, so as long as you have command you want to waste (er, spend), go crazy nuts, in my opinion...	
	It appears there are other ability cards that have spend command as well, so the general question is how exactly this works.	Spending command on ability cards goes back to the supply, so as long as you have command you want to waste (er, spend), go crazy nuts, in my opinion... For Refine, that’s really powerful! Repair a ship damage for each command. That means if you go to the Quarters in a four player game you can repair half the ship (5 damage) if desired.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598044/does-venom-damage-redistribute	Does Venom Damage Redistribute	No, in this case, if a crew member with venom has 0 health, ignore the effects of the venom token.	
	If crew member has zero health and poisoned, will the poison go away or does it stay.?	It stays until you remove it with an ability.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597986/gregory-synergy-token-question	If a character with Gregory's synergy token takes more damage than they have remaining health, does the excess damage go elsewhere and then you heal two, or do you heal two and then excess damage continues going on that character?  Thanks!	You hit zero and the rest of the damage goes away is distributed amongst other crew. Then you heal to 2.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597649/combat-damage-stacking	When an enemy has a double or triple heart, do you need to do 2 damage in one hit to cover it or can you place one damage and have another player place the 2nd damage on their turn?	You need the exact damage. 3 heart requires 3 damage on a single hit.	
	If there is a damage token in the middle of the enemy card and I wanted to place 3 damage...can I place damage to the right and left of the middle square and then one damage is nullified because of the middle square already containing damage?	You cannot cover damage that has already been covered. You have to go around it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597446/combat-clarifications	Can I put a damage token on an empty space?	Yes, you can place on empty spaces, this can be beneficial when trying to get damage from one side of the enemy's hit boxes to the other. (see Marco's synergy token for ideas on doing this efficiently)	
	When placing splash damage, must it be adjacent to damage places on the target?	Yes, damage adjacency must be preserved across the border between the cards. What you describe is accurate, only thing to add is that at least half of all damage done must be done to your initial target (namely the one you chose to attack first and meet its defense number) not necessarily where the 'first' damage goes. For example, dealing 3 damage to your enemies, 2 of the damage must be done to your initial target and 1 damage can splash to adjacent. This is a good way to get damage onto an enemy that has a high defense rating.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597408/equipping-an-ability-card-to-crew-members-which-on	Equipping An Ability Card To Crew Members - Which Ones?	Ability cards can be played to any crew member. It was confirmed elsewhere.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597321/challenge-discard-ability-card-require-participati	Must a crew member be assigned to a challenge to allow a player to discard a card to add skill to the total fate draw?	Any player (human) may discard an ability card from hand to add skill to the total fate draw, whether or not the player had any crew members participate in the challenge.	
	Can you only add skill to your own crew members, or any crew members?	You can pay command to equip ability cards to any crew members, even ones you don't control. Page 17 "You may spend command at any time, even on other players’ turns"	"You may spend command at any time, even on other players’ turns"
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597263/event-card-question	If you can't lose the X, can you still pick that option and just gain the 1 fatigue. Or if you can't pay the cost, you can't pick that option?	No, if you can't pay the cost, you cannot choose that option.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597180/status	When card such as “vegetable pie” says remove status, does that mean one status or all status or one status on all or all status on one crew member?	One status on one crew member. If it is more than one status and/or effects more than one crew member it specifies that.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596754/going-through-the-event-deck	After going through the event deck once (and reading the story), do you go through the same stack of events for the 2nd and 3rd times, or use 18 new events for each time through?	Somewhere in the rule book it says you return the used event cards into the box and start with a new set for each round.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596731/questions-regarding-combat	At the end of the combat round, after the monsters each deal their damage and any end of round (hourglass) attacks, do the monsters stay there for the next monster encounter, or do the monsters go back to the monster pile?	They stay there and another combat round starts.	
	So, then the grey combat cubes are gathered again, and given out to the players again, so on and so forth until the monsters are destroyed or the players die, right?	Right	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596709/combat-what-does-level-mean	Combat: What does level mean?	In the rule book there is a section near back that states difficulty levels for monsters. 16 is medium I believe. Each enemy also has its own "level", the encounter level is the sum of each enemy's level that is participating in that fight. It's a quick way for you to know how hard the fight will be before you choose that option (if you have a choice)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596679/do-i-have-to-do-map-challenges-when-passing-throug	Do I have to do map challenges when passing through?	I believe they're the 'entry cost' to get into that space.  They have to be done regardless of stopping or not. The rulebook says "If you move into a region with a hazard, you must complete the hazard's challenge or take the negative consequence." (p.13)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596627/can-you-flee-combat	Can you flee combat?	Technically, you "flee" when you're defeated. Monsters in this land will chase you down, apparently, so there's no escape.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596609/map-challenges-ie-storms-etc	We ran across the thunderstorm on the first map, and we're not sure exactly how we go about challenging it. Does the player whose turn it is activate a person for the challenge? Can you just draw a fate card, and use that number for the challenge, without using a person?	Yes, you don't need to allocate a character to challenges. You can just draw a card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2595766/resolved-artifact-tokens-what-is-their-use	Artifact tokens: What is their use?	The cardboard artifact tokens are used for end of game scoring, where they are worth 1 point each. They also have a 2 coin symbol on them, indicating they can be traded for 2 coins. Additionally, artifacts can be used at certain locations to trade for special adventure cards or effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2595755/campaign-end-trigger	what actually triggers the end of a campaign?	The campaign usually ends when you've run through the event deck three times.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594416/adjacent-regen-question	If an enemy has the “adjacent regen” power, does that regenerate one health on each adjacent monster (on both sides) for each box that has that keyword? Or does the box on the left only regenerate the enemy on the left, and the box on the right only regenerate the enemy on the right?	Adjacent Regen 1:This activates at the end of each combat round. Remove 1 damage token from each enemy card that is directly adjacent to this enemy card (the active player chooses which) To me that means for each ability printed on the card you do it once, so 2 printed Adjacent Regen, you do the ability twice per end of the combat round unless the ability is covered of course.	
	If a monster gets killed, but adjacent monster triggers the "Regenerate adjacent" ability, does it revive the killed monster? Does the revived monster also deal damage to the player characters?	A defeated enemy should be immediately removed from the array, and any remaining enemy cards should be moved closer together to get rid of the gap (if one was left). Because of this, it's not possible for a defeated enemy to still be "adjacent" to any of the other enemies.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594410/combat-question-enemy-order	Can’t find this in the rulebook or BGG. When setting up combat, are you free to line up the enemies in any order, or do they have to go in the order listed in the story book?	When you pull out the specific enemy cards for an encounter, you shuffle them and then lay them out according to the shuffled order. So it's randomized. You should be able to find this rule on page 21 of the rulebook or thereabouts	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594336/rule-questions	When an enemy makes its counter attack and does damage to the character that attacked the enemy, if there is extra damage does the active player choose one of their other characters to take the rest of the damage? If so, can the other character use their block to reduce some of that damage.	Yes, another character takes the remainder of the damage (doesn’t have to be yours). No, their block isn’t used.	
	When you heal players back up that only removes damage and not fatigue or status effects? For example if you were defeated from all players losing all of their health you need to heal everyone back to full health and remove all fatigue markers, but do you remove status effects?	Only if it tells you to.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594099/visiting-a-port-action-clarification	When visiting a Port as an Action, you can visit the Inn, pay 4 coins and “each crew member restores 2 health and removes 1 fatigue”. Is this limited to the active player’s crew members, or do all 9 crew receive the benefit?	All 9 receive the benefit, and you can use the sickbay to heal other player’s characters.	
	Can you choose to just flip a card and not add your accuracy bonus like you do in challenges?	For a challenge you're choosing which/how many character to use, so you can just choose not to use any characters and flip a fate anyway. For a combat action, you have to choose one specific character and weapon to use, so you do have to both add your accuracy and add fate. You can't make an attack without using a character, so you can't leave your accuracy bonus out.	
	I guess since you choose which weapon to use when you have more than one, you can always pick the one with lower accuracy bonus?	Yes, that's true!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2574093/ship-action-clarification	Before the ship action I have one command left in the pool. I place the worker on the bridge to draw 2 command and place all used command back in the pool. Is this action draw 2 then return all or is it a simultaneous action?	On page 10 of the rulebook it states "Ship action effects can be applied in any order". So you would be able to return all the used command to the pool then take 2.	"Ship action effects can be applied in any order".
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2571050/achievements-and-unlocked-cards-no-spoiler	Just wanted to clarify: I add the total number of Totems found and Endings achieved to reach a figure (for example 11). Then do I get all of the unlocked quest cards that correspond to the checked boxes up to and including 11? So if I reached eleven, would I get Quest cards 171-172, 169-170, 168 and 174? Or only 174?	Pretty sure you get all of them. The rules say you can choose to start with fewer Quests if you want to, for whatever reason.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2570282/instant-effect-rules-check	I assume an instant effect on an ability card like the healing from a bandage is immediate on equipping it to the character only and cannot be used again.Am I right?	Yes thats correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2566166/synergy-tokens	Can a crew member have multiple synergy tokens on their crew board?	Yes, a crew member can have multiple synergy tokens, and they can even use them together on the same attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	When moving the ship and entering a space showing a hazard (skill test) in the first space you move to, can you still move to a second space afterwards?	Yes you can continue to move. You just have to apply the negative effect if you failed the challenge but can still continue onward.	
	After having placed command tokens on a crew board to do the top ability, can you still do the bottom ability later, or do you need to remove all command first?	No. You can only use one command ability on a crew board and then need to remove all command before activating another crew board command ability.	
	Any player can discard a card from their hand to give +1 of the corresponding skill during a challenge, even if it's not that player's turn and even if his characters are not involved in the challenge?	Correct. Any player can discard any number of ability cards with the corresponding icon to help. They do not need to be involved in the challenge.	
	If you attack 2 enemies with a single attack (placing connecting cubes on the squares of 2 enemy cards), only the one you hit first will counterattack you immediately afterwards (provided that it didn't die)?	Correct. You only get counterattacked by the enemy you targeted. Just making sure that if you're placing more than 2 cubes, the majority have to be placed on the enemy you are targeting.	
	How and when does the game give command tokens to players?	You normally start the campaign with 1 command token per player, but every ship action location will give you some tokens. The only time you won't get any tokens is when there are none left in the bank.	
	Is there a player aid sheet in the box?	There is a player aid sheet in the box. It was one of the stretch goals.	
	Do credits from previous achievements carry over in subsequent campaigns?	Credits from previous achievements do not carry over but functionally are locked out: you are expected to avoid previously obtained totems.	
	Design-wise, if a monster card had two hourglass symbols, would it go twice in the monster attack phase?	No, multiple hour glass icons per enemy card are possible. During the End of Round phase of combat all enemies attack the players. If any of these monsters have one (or more) hour glass icons, these icons will then activate.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565586/numbers-on-hearts	What are the numbers on some of the heart-symbols on enemycards are for?	Numbers in hearts is the amount of damage required to put 1 damage token in that space. Numbers in flames is amount of damage added to monster attack if left uncovered. The flame symbols only need 1 damage token to cover them.	
	Can you help me where to find this in the rulesbook, please?	Page 25 in the top right corner	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2563480/blocking-leftover-damage-from-a-counterattack	Let's say a counterattack (not end of round attack) reduces a character to 0 health, but there is still leftover damage to assign. If I assign that damage to a character with access to block greater than 0, can I use that block to reduce the damage taken by this character at this point?	No, you only apply the block from the weapon you used in the same attack. So you would need to apply the leftover damage in full.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2563470/synergy-token-when-reduced-to-0-health	Let's say for example Rafael has a synergy token on Sofi's board.If Rafael is then reduced to 0 health, does his synergy token remain available to use on Sofi's board? Or is it removed from play?	Even if Rafael is reduced to 0 health, you can still use his synergy token on Sofi's board.	
	Now let's say Rafael still has his synergy token on his own board.If he then misses an attack and is reduced to 0 health by the counterattack, then places a damage token on a space with a synergy symbol - do I still get to place Rafael's synergy token on another character board?	And in the example, if Rafael misses an attack and is reduced to 0 health by the counterattack, but then places damage on a space with a synergy symbol, you still get to place Rafael's synergy token on another character board.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2562841/is-the-artifact-resource-token-just-worth-coins	If we were absolutely desperate for some quick cash, are we able to cash them in for the 2 coins, or are we obligated to keep them to use at a specified time?	Yes, you can use them at any time if you need to spend them as 2 coins.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2562724/defeat-due-to-all-crew-at-0-health	The rules for defeat only say to remove all crew damage and fatigue. Does this mean in normal mode I am meant to leave status tokens and command tokens in place when I resume?	Yes, keep fatigue and status tokens when you resume. Edit- Keep status and command on crew members after defeat, not fatigue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2561673/weapons	If player 1 purchases a weapon from the market, can player 2 equip the weapon onto one of their crew instead?	Yes, any player can equip the weapon. Players decide together who gets each weapon (in the case of a dispute, the Captain player decides).	
	If one of the crew from player 1 has a weapon, can they just pass that weapon onto another crew member or other player's crew member at no extra cost (i.e., spending command) or is that just not allowed at all once equipped?	Yes, you can pass weapons to other crew members at any time except during combat.	
	Can players swap crew members during their turn between players?	No, players cannot swap crew members between turns.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2543117/primeval-peril-rules-for-multiplayer	What are the differences in playing with two players?	- In CHALLENGES you can only use your crew members (and the captain); other crew members may be used, if the player spends one command - In COMBAT every player has to use Combat action tokens only on his own crew members (and the captain if active player); but you can pass them around for one command - You have more ability cards in hand (because every player is allowed to have up to 3 cards) - I think you can only spend command tokens for your own crew members...And that's it, isn't it? Because you gain a bit more command in two player games, its basically the same, isn't it?	
	All spend command tokens go directly back to supply except for crew abilities and adventure cards, correct?	This is all correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542651/adventure-cards-and-combat	In Peril, can a single character fight with more than one weapon or add cards from hand during combat?	Adventure cards that are 'Weapons' have to be equipped to individual crew members outside of combat, and you have to choose before attacking to use an equipped weapon or the crew member's default, so they cannot be used by multiple crew members during combat. You cannot add cards from hand during combat.	
	Are Adventure cards shared by all characters in Peril?	Other adventure cards like 'Equipment' are placed in the middle for use by anyone. Weapons, however, have to be equipped to individual crew members and cannot be shared during combat.	
	In combat, can every character use the same weapon?	No, weapons have to be equipped to individual crew members outside of combat and cannot be used by multiple crew members during combat.	
	Is Fatigue added to any character that does a challenge, but not combat?	Yes, fatigue is only added for challenges, but if a crew member is tired (2 tokens) they get -1 damage in combat (and cannot take part in challenges).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542447/combat-damage-after-missing	If I miss and then take the counterattack damage I am still able to do 1 damage correct?	Yes, you do 1 damage after the counterattack if you missed (and still have health).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2540037/arrow-icon-on-weapons	Does anyone know what the arrow icon on weapons like Twine’s Harpoon and Owens’ Derringer mean?	 Those are ranged weapons. It will only matter when you are facing flying monsters where non-ranged weapons will have reduced effectiveness.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537285/primeval-peril-discarding-ability-cards-wording	If a card just says "discard this card to..." rather than "discard this equipped card to..." can it simple be discarded from your hand directly to trigger the effect?	You're right, it should specify the equipped card but, you also must equipped an ability card to gain the ability hence if you don't have it equipped the ability text takes no effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537280/command-tokens-and-crew-board-abilities	When using the bridge action from the ship board do you have to remove all command tokens from all character boards, ability and adventure cards? or can you decide which to leave.	Yes, all command tokens should be returned to the supply.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537003/travel-and-hazard	Hello.If there is a Hazard in the first space I enter, can I travel more than 1 space after I resolve the challenge, no matter if I win or lose it ?	I reckon you can, rules don't say anything about this, the only thing is that if you enter a hazard space you must complete the hazard’s challenge or take negative consequences (and you always draw fate even if you decide not to fatigue anybody), after that you can take the remaining movement.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535700/weakened-status	Is this errata from where the  crew members have multiple skill points? And if not, how does it works?	If your crew member has 3 Cunning but is weakened, they now only have 1 Cunning. Same for the other skills.	
	What if I have no equipped strength ability card ? Is my total -1 ?	Technically yes, but you can't go below 0, so your total is 0.	
	I haven't played much yet. How do you remove status effects? Do you have to find it in the game or is it a rule I've missed?	The rulebook mentions statuses can be removed by character abilities and adventure cards. For example, pg. 34 says, "Remove Status: This can be used to remove status from any crew member" when referring to general crew abilities. The particular ability and adventure card will specify what it removes.	"Remove Status: This can be used to remove status from any crew member"
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535437/primeval-peril-venom-in-combat	If I get a venom token in a combat, do this crew member lose 1 health in the next combat round or in the next turn. Or more exactly, is a next combat round also a next turn?	Venom causes the crew member to lose 1 health at the start of each game turn (not in each combat round). For example, you end combat, complete your exploration action, and the turn ends. The next game turn starts, Jon has a venom token, so he loses 1 health. You then take your ship action, complete an event, etc.	
	Even if I control that character he loses 1 health in other players turns, right?	Correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535429/primeval-peril-splash-attack	If I attack two opponents with a splash attack, do they counterattack both, or only the one I have choosen to attack?	Only the one you chose to attack performs a counterattack. Other enemies hit by splash damage do not counterattack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535322/primeval-pwhat-does-remove-1-fatigue-mean	What does remove 1 fatigue mean?	If you gain a 2nd fatigue, the character should have a total of 2 tokens. The second token is placed showing the side with the “2 tokens: -1 damage” face up to remind you that if you have two tokens, you deal -1 damage.So the Aft Deck action just lets you remove one token.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533833/primeval-peril-ship-board-question	how does a command token get removed from that section so you can use it again?	It is treated as an adventure card, so the "Bridge" action can remove a command token from it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533113/block-and-weapons	Do you add all block values for a total Block of 3? Or do you only use the block of the equipped weapon for a total of 1?	You only apply block (the blue circle icon) with the weapon you use to attack, not all of the weapons you have equipped. And it only applies during the enemy counter attack (not the end-of-round enemy attacks).	
	I’m still not clear on the end of round attack. So you can’t block that at all?	Only by using specific adventure cards or using other special abilities. Weapon block doesn't count for end of round attacks.	
	I'm still confused. Could You clarify? Block from equipment cards adds to a block from weapons or no?	They are separate, so you can use both. Weapons can only block counterattacks, and you can only use 1 weapon (either printed on the character board or already equipped to that character before combat). Equipment can be used to block counterattacks and end-of-round attacks, but usually costs command to use.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532545/primevil-peril-game-end	Is finding Shen the game end condition?	There is indeed a story end you've not found yet! The storybook will tell you when you have a game over. You need to escape, still!	
	What should I do after finding Shen?	Try finding a way to sail off the map!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Does the weakened effect happen to all characters or just one?	Just 1 character gains a weakened token unless otherwise stated.	
	Should a fate card  always be drawn for every challenge?	Yes, you should draw fate for every challenge, even if there is small or no chance that you'll complete it successfully.	
	 Crew members with 2 fatigue cannot participate to a challenge. But can we use crew abilities or equipped ability cards of the exhausted crew members to alter the outcomes of the fate draw?	You can use crew abilities, but not equipped ability cards. Those only count if the crew member gains fatigue. You can, of course, discard ability cards from your hand to help.	
	Just to clarify, if the Captain has 2 Strength (including equipped abilities), I only get the +2 Strength if I put a fatigue on the Captain. But, if the Captain has the equipped ability Bold Attempt (discard to redraw fate), I could still use the ability even if the Captain did not spend fatigue to participate in the challenge, right? Also, if I did spend fatigue and the Captain gave +2 Strength, and then I discarded Bold Attempt to redraw fate, then now the Captain only contributes +1 Strength, right?	Still count the strength since the draw comes after having already decided to use the crew member.	
	 If I decide to don‘t use a crew member in a challenge, I draw a fate. Can I decide after the fate to use a crew member?	No, you cannot decide to use a crew member after the fate draw. You can, however, activate adventure cards or discard ability cards from hand to alter the final result.	
	If no crew member was chosen to fatigue and the challenge is failed, how is it determined which crew member suffers the consequences?	Anyone who participated takes consequences first, otherwise you choose who takes the consequences. You can split up damage between crew members how you like.	
	Not seeing a clarification on when to remove. Is it instantly, after that event is played, or end of turn?	First Time: After you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player’s turn. On the next turn, read paragraph 1 in the storybook instead of drawing an event card. Paragraph 1 will eventually tell you to remove the ability cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	Should specify if we can add cards after the result of the draw or not (ex. if I draw a 3 fate card may I still discard a Ability card to make it 4?)	Yes, you can. It's mentioned on p.13 "Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total." The "add 1 per card to the total" is clear to me. And it is even more clearly described in the Challenges section on p.19	"Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total."
	Just starting a new campaign for the first time. If no one is assigned, then who loses health?	If the result just says '-1 health' and no specific crew member is assigned, it is assumed that you can assign the health loss to whomever you want.	
	In Above and Below, did you know the numbers needed to succeed?	In Above and Below you absolutely did know the number(s) you needed to succeed, so it wasn't like you were blindly picking.	
	How is the skill number requirement handled in Sleeping Gods?	In Sleeping Gods, if it is your turn, you read the storybook. For each encounter, you'll be able to see the skill number requirement for the various choices. But you don't see the reward or the outcome until you have made your choice and succeeded/failed. The reaction paragraphs will not be on the same page as the story that you read so that you can't see the reward/consequence.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2256898/game-mechanics	Is it possible to do challenges / search over and over again? What's stopping you from doing the same action over and over again?	There's a timer built into the game, with the sleeping god attacking your ship after a period of turns. If you waste your time searching the same location over and over, you are giving yourself way less time to find the relics and win the game, and risking having your ship sunk.
