## How To Play (PAGE 7)

Play proceeds clockwise. You will take turns performing one of the following actions. These actions may be performed in any order, but only one action may be taken per turn.

- Place A Worker<br>
- Or Play A Card<br>
- Or Prepare For Season

### PLACE A WORKER
Your workers are necessary for the expansion and success of your city. You will be deploying them to various locations in Everdell in order to gather resources, draw more cards, host events, or perhaps to embark on a journey.

There are two types of locations: exclusive and shared (portrayed with an open encircling ring). Only 1 worker may visit an exclusive location. Multiple workers, even of the same color, may visit a shared location.

To visit a location, place one of your workers on any available symbol and immediately take the listed resources or perform the action. That worker is then considered deployed to that location until you bring them back with the Prepare for Season action.

Example: Placing a worker on the second basic action space gains the player two twigs, and a card drawn from the deck.

### Locations To Visit Include

#### 1. Basic Action Spaces
#### 2. Forest Locations
The placement locations are only used in a four-player game. However, you may not place 2 of your own workers on a single Forest location.

#### 3. Destination Cards (PAGE 8)
You may place a worker on any Destination card in your city, or on a Destination card in another city that has an symbol, in which case the owner of the Destination gains 1 point token from the supply.<br>
Example: If another player places their worker on the Post Office, the owner gains 1 point.

#### 4. Haven
The Haven location is a shared space. There is no limit to the amount of workers that may be placed on it, even of the same color. By going here, you may discard any number of cards from your hand, and gain 1 of any resource for every 2 cards you discard.

#### 5. Events
Grand Tour Event requires your city to contain 3 destination cards.<br>
Woodcarver, Chapel requires your city to contain woodcover and chapel.
You may also place 1 of your workers on any remaining basic Event or special Event to achieve it. To achieve the Event, you must meet all the listed requirements on the Event, and must pay any resources at the time you place your worker there. Only one player may achieve a specific Event. You have to be able to achieve the Event to place a worker on the Event.
Achieved Events should be placed beside your city for scoring at the end of the game.

#### 6. Journey
In autumn only, you may send a worker on a journey. You must discard cards equal to the listed points of the Journey location you choose. The 5-point, 4-point, and 3-point locations are exclusive, and the 2-point location is shared. The deployed worker is worth the listed points at the end of the game.

## PLAY A CARD (PAGE 9)
You may play one card. To play a card, you must pay the listed requirements into the general supply. Cards may be played from either the Meadow cards or from your hand.

You will be playing these cards in front of you to form your city. There are two types of cards in the game: Critters and Constructions. You may have multiple copies of any Common card in your city, but you may only have one specific copy of any Unique card.

You may pay the required cost in berries to play the Critter card, or if the Construction listed in the top left of the Critter card is already in your city, you may play the Critter card without paying the cost in berries.

<b>Important:</b> When playing a Critter for free by using the related Construction, place an "occupied" token on the Construction. You may only do this once per Construction.

### City (PAGE 10)
Your city has a maximum of 15 spaces to play cards into. Each card takes up one space. Recommended layout is 3 rows with 5 cards in each. Event cards do not count against this 15 card limit.
#### Card Types

- Tan Traveler: Activates once immediately when played. It never activates again.

- Green Production: Activates once immediately when played, and once during the Prepare for Season actions in spring and autumn.

- Red Destination: Activates when a worker is placed on it. Cards with the symbol may be visited by opponents.

- Blue Governance: Grants you bonuses after playing certain card types, and offers different ways to play cards for a discount.

- Purple Prosperity: Worth the base points and the listed bonus points at the end of the game.

#### Drawing Cards

Always draw cards from the deck, unless specifically told to draw them from the Meadow cards.

There is a strict hand limit of eight cards. You cannot ever have more than eight cards in your hand. If you get to draw cards, you can only draw up to eight, no more. If you are required to give cards to an opponent and all opponents' hands are full, discard the cards instead.

If a Meadow card is played, immediately replace it with a new card from the draw pile. If an ability allows players to draw cards from the Meadow cards, draw all cards first then replenish.

If the deck ever runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

> Gain: take listed resources or point tokens from the general supply.<br>
> Pay: place listed resources from your supply into the general supply.

## Prepare For Season (PAGE 11)

Thematically the game begins in late winter and ends as the next winter approaches. Autumn is the last Prepare for Season action you may perform in the game.

The Prepare for Season action may only be performed after you have placed all of your current worker population.

When you perform the Prepare for Season action, you alone bring back all of your deployed workers.

In spring, you gain 1 new worker and activate all green Production cards in your city.

In summer, you gain 1 new worker. There is no Production in summer, but green cards still activate immediately if played during summer. Also, you may draw up to 2 Meadow cards when you prepare for summer.

In autumn, you gain 2 workers and activate all green Production cards in your city.

When preparing for the next season, new workers from the Ever Tree join your growing city. Gain your matching worker and activate the next season's listed bonus.

 

## End Game (PAGE 13)

When you cannot perform any more actions (or do not wish to), you have finished the game and must pass. If a player has passed, they cannot be given any cards or resources. If cards or resources have to be given to a player and all other players have passed, discard instead.

Any unfinished players continue playing until all players have passed. Then add up all points to determine the winner.

You may find it easiest to add up the base value of each card, then come back and add up point tokens, purple Prosperity card bonuses, Journey points, and Events.

If there is a tie, the player who achieved the most Events wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the most leftover resources is the winner.

### SCORING EXAMPLE (PAGE 14)
Base points for cards: 22 <br>Point tokens: 14<br>Prosperity card bonus points: 10 (3 for Wife, 2 for Architect, 5 for King)<br> Journey points: 4 <br> Events: 12 (6 for Performer in Residence, 3 for Ministering to Miscreants, 3 for Grand Tour)<br>
Total: 62

## SOLO RULES (PAGE 15)
When playing Everdell solo, you will be competing against a cantankerous old rodent known as Rugwort, and his pack of rowdy, rambunctious, rat ruffians. He will be returning to Everdell for three years in a row, each time bearing a new title of nastiness. You must find a way to overcome his dastardly tricks and rid Everdell of his filth once and for all!

### Year One: "Rugwort the Rascal"
Select a player color for Rugwort (he prefers black) and setup the game according to the two-player setup. You have a starting hand of 5 cards, and Rugwort does not have a hand of cards.

Take one of Rugwort's workers and place it on the top-left Forest card, blocking it. Place his other worker on the 3 twig action space, blocking it.

Play the game as normal with these new rules:

Any time after you play a card, Rugwort gets to play a card. If you played a Meadow card, first replenish the card. To play Rugwort's card, roll the 8-sided die; the number rolled will determine which of the 8 Meadow cards Rugwort gets to play into his city. The cards are numbered 1-8, with the top-left being 1 and the bottom-right being 8. For Rugwort's city, place his cards in stacks according to colored types so you can clearly see how many he has of each color. The card's ability and point value do not matter. Replenish the Meadow card after he has played his card.

After you have performed the Prepare for Season action, Rugwort immediately performs his Prepare for Season action, which consists of these steps:

1) Check to see if he has enough of the colored cards in his city to achieve any of the four basic Events. If so, place that Event(s) in his city.

2) Take his new worker and place it on the #1 Meadow card (#2 for summer, and #3 & #4 for autumn), so by the end of the game he will have a worker on the top 4 Meadow cards. You cannot play these cards anymore, but Rugwort still can.

3) Moving counter-clockwise, move his worker to the next Forest card.

During the spring Prepare for Season action, move his worker from the 3 twigs location to the 2 resin location. During summer, move his worker to the 1 pebble location. During autumn, move his worker to the 1 berry and 1 card location.

In autumn, remove his worker from the 3rd Forest tile and place it instead on the 3-point Journey space.

### Scoring
Rugwort will score: 2 points per card in his city (3 points for each purple Prosperity card), 3 points for each basic Event he achieved, 3 points for each special Event that you did not achieve, 3 points for his worker on Journey, and any point tokens that you gave him.

### Year Two: "Rugwort the Rotten"
Same rules as Year One with these additional rules:

Place his worker on the 4-point Journey space instead of the 3.

Rugwort gains 6 points for every special Event that you did not achieve, instead of 3.

### Year Three: "Rugwort the Rapscallion"
Same rules as Year Two with these additional rules:

Place his worker on the 5-point Journey space instead of the 4.

During Rugwort's autumn Prepare for Season action, he kidnaps one of your workers! Do not move his worker to the 1 berry and 1 card space—instead remove his worker and one of your workers from the game. Now you will only have 5 workers to use for the last season of the game.

Beat him in year three and the bards of Everdell sing of your triumph! The historian records your victory to be preserved and remembered for all time! The old rat Rugwort skulks away, leaving Everdell in peace... for now.
