Just remember that a crew member can only use one of the abilities on their card until command tokens are removed. 2. Short answer is yes.

If you draw a number that already has full damage, you place the damage on another spot of your choice on the ship.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3016096/spoiler-number-of-totems-at-the-final,Is it more enjoyable to not focus strictly on collecting 8 totems in Sleeping Gods?,"Hmm… my first thought when reading this was: it might be more enjoyable when one doesn’t see Sleeping Gods as a strict “you have to have 8 totems or you lose” or “you have to get back or you lose”. At least for me, it’s more about starting a journey and seeing what I experience. I had campaigns where I only got a few totems, others where we were swimming in totems. So if your goal is to find more totems, it’s not necessarily about using information from previous campaigns. It helped me much more to be strategic where I explored and which leads I followed. Like don’t start grinding whole coast lines. Pick a spot that looks interesting (defaulting to a port), pick up a quest and follow it, doing additional exploring where you end your movement anyway. That way one doesn’t waste too much time. When I ended up with few totems it was usually because I went wherever and randomly explored or I went on a difficult quest without having weapons or at least a lot of command. That said, last campaign I unexpectedly found a way how to get the whole crew home, everybody is happy, and I neither had 8 totems nor was even at the end of the second event deck.
