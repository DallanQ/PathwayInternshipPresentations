https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605775/synergy-tokens	Do synergy tokens stay on character cards after the combat in which they were placed?	"No.Pg 25 of the main rulebook, ""At the start of each battle, make sure that each crew member's synergy token is on the matching crew board.""

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640957/finished-game-question-on-campaign-unlocked-cards	For future campaigns, does this mean I unlock all the Quest cards before 15...? So in this table, do I get only cards 176-177, or am I able to get all cards listed below 16...?	You add up unique totems and endings you got and unlock everything up to and including that number. Don't miss the card 179 since you take cards from 178 to 180 once you reach #18.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248418/if-i-equip-a-weapon-to-my-crew-can-i-equip-other-c	If I equip a weapon to my crew, can I equip other crew members with that weapon whenever I want?	"according to rulebook p.29 - not in combat""You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only the weapon info is showing""I think that same rule also apply to totem weapons. believe you can switch which character is using a weapon at any time outside of combat. Once combat begins, you cannot make any changes."	You can equip this to a crew member (or give it to a different crew member) at any time outside of combat. Slide it underneath their crew board so that only theweapon info is showing.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3101836/both-crew-members-dead	What happens when it comes to your turn but all the crew members you are controlling are defeated?  Do you take your turn like normal and then just have no crew members available to handle anything that comes up?	Yeah, you still take your turn. Other players can still contribute to challenges by paying command.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	If you attack 2 enemies with a single attack (placing connecting cubes on the squares of 2 enemy cards), only the one you hit first will counterattack you immediately afterwards (provided that it didn't die)?	Correct. You only get counterattacked by the enemy you targeted. Just making sure that if you're placing more than 2 cubes, the majority have to be placed on the enemy you are targeting.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738225/location-190-g-and-her-gcs-spoilers	When you complete a task for a passenger, what happens to the adventure card depicting them?	"If the text said ""Lose Adventure card X"" you put it into the Used quests box. If the text said nothing, but the person has left thematically, either keep the card or house rule it and put it to the Used quests. You should never put a card back in the magnetic box."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2960501/travel	Will the Sea Serpent token follow us even if we move to a new page? Across multiple pages? What if we use an effect to arrive at a new space but not by “travel”?	It will follow you wherever you go. Page 12:  “ Hunting Serpent Special Rule: For this event, if you turn to a new page of the atlas, place the serpent on the region your ship starts in.”	“ Hunting Serpent Special Rule: For this event, if you turn to a new page of the atlas, place the serpent on the region your ship starts in.”
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3143866/card-stone-of-blood	According to the rules of the game, a command token may be spent at any time. This should also apply to the time of the combat, right?	You are correct. Adventure cards can be triggered outside of a character strike/attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3057695/artifacts-what-for	Artifacts - what for.	They are another type of resource (like meat, grain, material etc.)  you can find in the game. These tokens can be spent as 2 coins at any time. There are also some special locations that allow you to spend artifacts to gain rare treasures or effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2889652/crew-abilities	During a challenge, is it only crew members who are assigned to the task (and got fatigued) who can use their starting abilities (or equipped ones) to help swing the outcome after the fate draw, or can any crew member use their abilities effects to help so long as they pay the command cost?	It depends. If it says 'you', then only the player drawing a fate card can use one of their committed characters.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	Should specify if we can add cards after the result of the draw or not (ex. if I draw a 3 fate card may I still discard a Ability card to make it 4?)	"Yes, you can. It's mentioned on p.13 ""Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total."" The ""add 1 per card to the total"" is clear to me. And it is even more clearly described in the Challenges section on p.19"	Next, draw fate. If you used a crew member, add 1 for each craft symbol they have. You may also discard ability cards with craft symbols from your hand to add 1 per card to the total.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3250276/when-doing-a-challenge-can-i-not-use-a-crew-member	Do you give all the damage to one designated crew member and move on to the next crew member, or do you split the damage up little by little?	Damage must be applied to any crew members that participated first. Since no crew participated, damage goes to whoever you want.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2606614/ability-clarifications-not-so-clear	"Is the ""General Crew Board Ability Rules"" section only for crew board abilities, or does it apply to Ability Cards abilities as well?"	Ability cards generally follow the same rules as general crew board abilities, assuming it is not otherwise specified.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2904319/sleeping-gods-as-an-action-question	"Certain negative ongoing events in Sleeping Gods state on their cards that ""as an action"" one may attempt a certain challenge (e.g., a STRENGTH 7 check) to remove the event.Does this mean that you can try using up one of your two actions at the final part of your turn to attempt this challenge and remove the event? Or, does it mean you can attempt the challenge once per turn at will on your turn (without using up either of your usual two actions) to try and get rid of the event?"	It's the first one - it uses one of your 2 actions in your turn to attempt the challenge to overcome it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2821451/each-time-when-i-use-up-a-deck-of-event-cards-shou	When I prepare the new deck should I randomly draw from the rest of 36 cards or from the 54 cards? And second time, should I just use the rest of 18 cards?	From the rest of the 36, and then use the remaining 18. When I finish each round of the event deck, I place those cards on the Completed Quests' box so that I don't mix them up until the end of the campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3205199/are-the-rings-considered-a-line	Are the rings considered a line?	"Assuming you mean the ring binder of the map book, then yes that is a border. Quote from the sleeping gods rulepop""Regions are separated by dotted lines, land, the spiral binding of the atlas, and the edge of the page.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3018777/items-that-give-block	"For items that give block (such as the serpent scale vest in the rulebook), does the item give that block bonus for one hit?  Or for the entire combat?  I realize it's ""temporary,"" but I'm not sure how temporary."	It only applies to a single attack.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2793408/can-level-cards-be-counted-as-skill	can level cards be counted as skill?	Yes, we definitely count them. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any reason for them to have skill icons.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597263/event-card-question	If you can't lose the X, can you still pick that option and just gain the 1 fatigue. Or if you can't pay the cost, you can't pick that option?	No, if you can't pay the cost, you cannot choose that option.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2623697/are-status-tokens-limited	Are status tokens limited?	Yes. All tokens are limited except damage tokens. There are only 4 of each status token except low morale, so if you have 4 of your crew weakened, for example, then nobody else can become weakened until someone is cured. Updated rule book page 8.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3129703/exhausted-event-decks-after-era-1-what-happens-aft	Is it normal in video games to find something that needs a specific item or keyword to progress?	Yes, it is a normal part of the design in many video games. Players often need to find a specific item or keyword to progress, which is a common gameplay mechanic.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2379921/rulebook	In Above and Below, did you know the numbers needed to succeed?	In Above and Below you absolutely did know the number(s) you needed to succeed, so it wasn't like you were blindly picking.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	"When the rulebook says ""any crew member"" (e.g. removing Fatigue in the Galley, removing damage in the Sick Bay), should I assume it always means ""even crewmembers controlled by another player"", unless specified? Or are there any big exceptions to this?"	"Yes.  ""Any Crew"" means any of the crew, including the Captain and crew controlled by other players."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	"Specifically Challenges and applying status tokens. It says ""your"", but since other players can contribute characters to a challenge by spending a command, I assume they can also be the target of a status token. Bigger question is if no characters participate in the challenge and a status token needs to be placed, can it go on another player's character?"	"Context is important, but it normally means the crew which one player controls. For example, Rulepop says: ""If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped.""

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601294/questions-combat-and-ship-action	Can I run away if I'm doomed?	You can never run away (unless the story book explicitly gives that option somewhere).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2609108/where-do-search-icons-come-from	"Where do ""Search"" icons come from?"	Search is a ship action. Station 2. You play a game of chicken with yourself and turn over between 1 and 3 tokens. You get to keep the reward from only 1 token, but you take ship damage (and lost morale, and maybe other stuff I'm forgetting) from every token you draw. The binoculars allow you to ignore one damage per point of YOUR perception from Search Tokens you've drawn in the above mini-game.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659771/when-is-the-middle-of-combat-for-ability-card-purp	When can I cook a recipe? In the middle of a noncombat challenge? In the middle of an exploration before making a choice? After reading text?	Any time, except during combat. “During combat” means any time after you’ve looked at the enemy cards and before they are defeated. If you see there is combat about to happen, the game rules allow you to eat before fighting (thematically, you ate the food before the fight started).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2542651/adventure-cards-and-combat	Are Adventure cards shared by all characters in Peril?	Other adventure cards like 'Equipment' are placed in the middle for use by anyone. Weapons, however, have to be equipped to individual crew members and cannot be shared during combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2873881/i-have-some-questions-after-first-session	What is the significance of the combat token?	They are use to count the amount of attacks you have in a given combat round (=4); and you cannot place more than 2 tokens on the same crew member. You use the combat token to indicate who is attacking the monster(s). I.o.w.: you don't let all of your crew members attack the monsters one after another (that would make combat VERY easy).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2896109/defeated-in-normal-mode-and-event-deck	If I am defeated in normal mode, I should discard 6 cards from the event deck. If after discarding a few cards (less than 6), I run out of event cards, should I read paragraph 1 and afterwards continue discarding cards up to 6, or should I shuffle the event deck, discard up to six, finish my turn and then read paragraph 1?	It's #1. Discard as many as you can. Read the paragraph, (which will tell you to create a new deck of 18) Then discard the rest of what you owe off of the new deck.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2599551/what-if-you-cant-place-the-last-attack-damage	When dealing splash damage, if you do 2 damage to a 2 heart, can you then put 2 damage (across two boxes) to another enemy?	Damage dealt. So yes, you could do 2 damage to a 2 heart (covering only one box), and then put 2 damage (across two boxes) as splash damage to another enemy.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3012276/do-discarded-ability-cards-go-to-the-bottom-of-the	Do discarded ability cards go to the bottom of the gate deck?	"Rulebook, p. 10 under Ship Action: ""If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck.""...so, you create a discard pile and reshuffle it as needed."	If the ability deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to make a new ability deck.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2971238/what-means-the-plus-before-the-accuracy-number-ob	Can I add starting weapon accuracy and accuracy of added weapons or added ability cards together?	No.  You use either your starting weapon or an equipped weapon.  Not both.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2608452/when-you-cook-a-recipe-ability-card-clarification	"If the active player, who controls said character, pays 1 COMMAND on ""Flapjacks"" (it's a starting card), will I get the bonus included under that power?"	"I think this is clarified in the rulebook that the ""YOU"" is always referring to the active player - so Option #1 is correct, assuming the active player/controller are both you, which sounds like it is based on your wording. If you are playing solo - you are always the owner and active player so you will always get the bonus when cooking a recipe."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535700/weakened-status	What if I have no equipped strength ability card ? Is my total -1 ?	Technically yes, but you can't go below 0, so your total is 0.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2966219/reading-events	When reading events, if it calls for a test or something does it work same way as a challenge? Like someone is picked and fatigued and other people can add more if they wish, etc?	Yeah absolutely, you can as always choose whether or not you want crew members to participate, following standard challenge rules.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596609/map-challenges-ie-storms-etc	We ran across the thunderstorm on the first map, and we're not sure exactly how we go about challenging it. Does the player whose turn it is activate a person for the challenge? Can you just draw a fate card, and use that number for the challenge, without using a person?	Yes, you don't need to allocate a character to challenges. You can just draw a card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3201053/losing-during-a-battle	If, during a battle, I manage to slay some of the enemies but then I lose, if I will go back to that battle in the future, does it mean that the enemies I have killed don’t take part in the battle anymore, or are they revived and I have to kill them one more time?	You set up the battle from scratch and fight all enemies again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838292/enemy-ability-reference	What is the suggested house rule for handling market cards?	The suggestion is to create a market stack tied to the market at that location in the atlas instead of sending un-purchased cards to the bottom of the deck. This would allow players to return and purchase items they previously couldn't afford, giving each market a unique personality.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2562724/defeat-due-to-all-crew-at-0-health	The rules for defeat only say to remove all crew damage and fatigue. Does this mean in normal mode I am meant to leave status tokens and command tokens in place when I resume?	Yes, keep fatigue and status tokens when you resume. Edit- Keep status and command on crew members after defeat, not fatigue.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	 If I decide to don‘t use a crew member in a challenge, I draw a fate. Can I decide after the fate to use a crew member?	No, you cannot decide to use a crew member after the fate draw. You can, however, activate adventure cards or discard ability cards from hand to alter the final result.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831400/location-29-minor-spoiler	Moreover, since I can’t find a rule that prevents you to explore the same location twice in one turn, is it possible to explore location 29 twice in the same turn in order to sell more than four items (obviously Status Tokens) for coins?	you can explore the same location twice on your turn, but each explore costs you 1 action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022338/when-monsters-atack	When in a combat you have done your 4 attacks and then is the monsters' turn to attack, who do they attack? Who gets the damage?	The active player decides which crew members are attacked by each enemy card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533833/primeval-peril-ship-board-question	how does a command token get removed from that section so you can use it again?	"It is treated as an adventure card, so the ""Bridge"" action can remove a command token from it."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601437/a-smattering-of-post-play-questions-search-tokens	In the case of needing coins for a trade, how many coins do you need to choose the option?	You only need 1 coin to use that option, you don't need extra to cover possible failure consequences.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3135448/when-giving-unused-combat-action-tokens-who-gets-t	When giving unused combat action tokens, who gets the token back at the start of the next round?	Just for the round. Next round, each player gets their combat markers back.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3088398/when-you-go-through-the-event-deck-the-firstsecond	Is this how you play it out? My scenario: Player A starts their turn. They take a ship action, they draw the last event card and resolve it, they take their two actions (Travel, Explore, Port, Market). Player B starts their turn. They take a ship action, they read/resolve story 1 (since there are no event cards here), they take their two actions	Yes, that's correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596679/do-i-have-to-do-map-challenges-when-passing-throug	Do I have to do map challenges when passing through?	"I believe they're the 'entry cost' to get into that space.  They have to be done regardless of stopping or not. The rulebook says ""If you move into a region with a hazard, you must complete the hazard's challenge or take the negative consequence."" (p.13)"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3070941/did-we-win-or-lose-this-combat	Did we win or lose this combat?	"Page 22 (upper left) of the rule book: ""Enemy Health: Each heart must be covered to defeat the enemy."" Since your crew did that, I'd say the battle was won."	Enemy Health: Each heart must be covered to defeat the enemy.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596754/going-through-the-event-deck	After going through the event deck once (and reading the story), do you go through the same stack of events for the 2nd and 3rd times, or use 18 new events for each time through?	Somewhere in the rule book it says you return the used event cards into the box and start with a new set for each round.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2570282/instant-effect-rules-check	I assume an instant effect on an ability card like the healing from a bandage is immediate on equipping it to the character only and cannot be used again.Am I right?	Yes thats correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794921/quest-clarification	Does this mean that Mac is unavailable, not on the ship, can’t help during combat, etc, until the crew goes to this cabin and gets her?	No, unless a quest or part of the storybook specifically says a character is unavailable then they are available. I've only run across one such case and it was very clear. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605658/multiple-keywords-for-an-explore	Shoot! We played it where we could pick which keyword we wanted to use, since we had both (and the one seemed bad). But hindsight, that does make sense to start from top down. Ugh, well now I feel like we missed out on something or altered the game...we are a few turns after that explore action and seems it'll be a hassle to revert back. Think it'll be okay to go forward, or should we revert back?	Just move on. Mistakes will happen. It's not worth backtracking more than one turn. You will know for the future.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809353/combat-token-placement	Combat token placement?	In the rules, players can give each other unused combat action tokens, but each time a combat token is given, one of the players (giving or receiving) must pay 1 command. This implies it's per round, not just once for the entire combat. If you don't have the command, then those tokens can't be used. Additionally, if Player A was the active player when the combat started, they can still place tokens on the Captain, unless the Captain is also at 0 health.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2561673/weapons	Can players swap crew members during their turn between players?	No, players cannot swap crew members between turns.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533113/block-and-weapons	I’m still not clear on the end of round attack. So you can’t block that at all?	Only by using specific adventure cards or using other special abilities. Weapon block doesn't count for end of round attacks.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2997393/solo-game	So I play with all the crew members. Why I use fewer ability cards? It’s written on the rules?	Yes: rules say that 1 ability card per player as a starting point (and not crew member). Later on, there is a limit of 3 per player - so in solo that is still 3 max!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3254605/discard-activity-cards	Can you discard cards during any challenge to increase your success?	Yes, any player may discard any number of ability cards from their hands to add the associated skill to the challenge. 	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659537/list-of-ability-card-questions-and-answers	What is the intended design of World Wisdom?	Reveal the event card and read it, discard World Wisdom, ignore everything on the event card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683876/challenges-step-3-can-you-use-abilities-on-chars-n	Does the 'Redraw Fate if 1' ability on Kasumi's Crew Board apply only if the active player controls Kasumi?	No, the 'Redraw Fate if 1' ability does not strictly require the active player to control Kasumi. It is interpreted that the ability can be activated by the active player using command on Kasumi's card, allowing the active player to redraw fate. This interpretation is supported by a discussion in another thread, indicating flexibility in using crew board abilities even if the crew member didn’t participate in the previous step of the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2849626/regular-challenges-vs-travel-challenges	Is it correct that for the craft challenge performed during the travel action, you can use at most one crew member?	Yes, you can only use 1 crew member for the specific Craft challenge during the Travel Action. This is because thematically, only 1 person can ultimately pilot the ship at a time.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2776331/what-order-are-enemies-supposed-to-be-arranged	What order are enemies supposed to be arranged?	Shuffle the cards you just retrieved and place them face up in a row in the center of the table, without any space between cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598711/can-you-use-recipes-in-combat	Can you however cook right before combat. So a combat is happening, but you haven't started it yet. Can you cook then?	"Yes, you can cook right before combat (or right after), just not during. Again page 18, ""You can, however, cook recipes in the middle of an explore action."" Page 17, bolded ""You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge."" So as long as you're not in the middle of either of those activities, you can add a new ability card to a crew member."	"Again page 18, ""You can, however, cook recipes in the middle of an explore action."" Page 17, bolded ""You may not equip an ability card in the middle of combat or in the middle of a challenge."""
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2852034/end-of-each-event-deck	"Where is this ""discard all equipped ability cards"" rule documented? I don't see it anywhere in the rule book."	"It's part of the instructions in the storybook when you complete the ""end-of-event-deck"" story encounter."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2688585/discarding-surprise-strike-when-equipped-to-kasumi	Would Discarding Surprise Strike while equipped to Kasumi when dealing damage allow for +2 damage?	"No. From the rulebook (p.34): ""Surprise Strike: Discard the card to deal 1 damage (no enemy counterattack.) You do not need to draw fate or use a combat action token to deal this damage.""Surprise Strike does not add damage to an attack you're already making; it's a separate 1-damage attack. (That's why the card's damage icon has a '1' and not a '+1' like Rafael or Mac's board abilities.) You can discard it at any time to deal one damage, or you can discard the skill for its Cunning after a successful attack to add one to Kasumi's total damage - not both."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604443/question-about-dungeons-solo	Added the Dungeons into the mix with my 3rd campaign, like them a lot, just to clarify there are 3 actions:1. Move2. Explore3. CampEach player gets 3 actions, so when playing solo it seems like there is no reason to break it down to 3 actions per round since the rules do not say that the actions have to be different.  Thus just move and explore until the characters need a rest and then camp.Hope I was playing this correctly.	Yeah, I don't think there's any reason to keep track of sets of 3 actions when you're playing solo. It seems like a way to get all players involved during multiplayer so it isn't just the player who took the initial explore action to enter the dungeon making all of the decisions.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3266861/audries-power-block	"But why does it say that ""Audrie's 2nd crew board ability gives +1 block""?"	Some of the crew abilities can be used in combat. Audrie's second now gets an additional +1 block so you can use it in combat.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2797643/lukran-engine-rules-clarity	Can I pay 2 command to travel only 1 distance?	"Yes. From the Travel rule entry: ""For each distance you may move to 1 adjacent region."""	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661332/can-i-use-multiples-of-a-crew-ability	Can I use multiples of a crew ability?	No, because on certain ability cards, you don't put the Command Token on the card, you just discard the token, that's why you can reuse the card. Whereas with crew abilities, you place the command token on the used ability, preventing you from using it again until it is removed.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2810990/symbols-next-to-titles-in-storybook	Some have them, most don't.  What are they (if the answer isn't a spoiler of some kind)?	If it's what I'm thinking of, it indicates the author of that section. If you check the beginning of the Storybook, you should see that icon next to the writer's name.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831400/location-29-minor-spoiler	Does this mean I can sell four items of the same type (like 4 Status Tokens) or do I have to sell one item of different types (like 1 Material + 1 Artifact + 1 Food)?	yes, you can sell 4 of the same type.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035910/setup-question-give-each-player-1-command-and-one	"What is a ""command card""? Or does it mean ""command token""? In regards to the ability cards, do we just get dealt one randomly... or???????"	"It means to give one command token and one ability card. When the rules refer to gaining or spending those tokens, they are simply referred to as a ""command"" rather than a ""command token"". For the ability cards, one is dealt to each player off the top of the deck."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2841162/possible-to-re-gain-a-completed-quest	What would have happened then?	Based on the nature of that keyword and what it involves, I'm guessing they wanted there to be more than 1 way to be able to find it. So I would guess if you come across twice in the same playthrough, just ignore the second instance.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3058777/can-i-equip-an-ability-to-another-crew-member-once	Can I equip an ability to another crew member once equipped?	You can change the owner of a weapon anytime outside of combat. Ability cards, however, cannot be changed. The Rulepop Command reference mentions you can discard equipped ability cards at any time. You can get rid of them, but you'd have to wait until they cycle through the deck in order to reacquire and equip them to someone else. Nope. You cannot swap ability cards once equipped.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2640098/cooking-questions	For 1 command and no ingredients, I can remove 1 fatigue and cure 4 hearts! Is this so...? And, can these be done on any character or it needs to be on one character?	Yes, that is all basically correct!	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3210769/adventure-card-command-tokens	  Is the player able to keep activating the same adventure card if there is already command token on it, by placing more command tokens each time?	Once a card has command on it, the command token(s) must be removed before it can be used again.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2897149/crew-abilities	When a crew ability is doing two actions, e.g. removing a status token + recovering one health, as in the following picture, can those be applied to different crew members?	You can only activate one crew ability at a time, and would need to remove command from that crew member before attempting to use another ability of that member: 'Activate Crew AbilityYou may pay command to activate one of your crew member’s abilities. Place the required command on their crew board to indicate that they have used an ability, then gain the effects. You may not use another ability on this crew member until all command tokens have been removed from their crew board.'	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3022849/stamina-level-card-of-odessa-what-does-it-mean	Stamina Level Card of Odessa. What does it mean?	It means the character suffers the same affects as having two fatigue tokens, but they can also have a third token. You would need to lose 2 tokens (i.e. have only one token left) to negate the negative effects of having fatigue tokens.(I.e. three tokens is just as bad as two tokens, but usually you can’t have more than two tokens, except with this ability).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2628956/revisiting-sites-and-totems-in-a-new-campaign	If the Storybook tells you (for example) that in the future you are allowed access to the village and villagers whenever you wish, would that apply to a new Campaign as well?	No	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2898953/dungeon-item-hearthcoal-move-ship-3-distance	My second query was whether it is considered an action or not.	My logic tells me it's not an action as the rulebook does not refer to it as an action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Does the weakened effect happen to all characters or just one?	Just 1 character gains a weakened token unless otherwise stated.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794525/question-about-splash-damage	On the rule book it says I can do splash damage as long as I deal half of damage to the monster that I targeted.So what does it mean half of damage?Is it the amount of damage (quantity of enemy’s heart) or just damage token that I’m supposed to put on the enemy card?	Good question.  I'd say it's the damage.  The rules say at least half of the damage must go on the targeted enemy - not 'half of the damage counters'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533113/block-and-weapons	Do you add all block values for a total Block of 3? Or do you only use the block of the equipped weapon for a total of 1?	You only apply block (the blue circle icon) with the weapon you use to attack, not all of the weapons you have equipped. And it only applies during the enemy counter attack (not the end-of-round enemy attacks).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2905767/kasumi-s-synergy-token	I think Rafael has one level up card that allows him to only have to place 1 damage on his initial target and then he can place the rest on an adjacent enemy. This way, you can use an enemy with low defense to land the hit, and roll over damage into an enemy with a high defense.		
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879839/accuracy-on-an-attack	"Then why does it say ""you may use adventure card"" abilities that add to accuracy after the draw?"	You can use any adventure card - they belong to the whole crew, as it were - whereas the crew boards themselves have attack/damage bonuses specific to each crew member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2617834/miss-damage-against-flying-enemies-with-non-ranged	Do you do any damage when you miss a flying enemy with a non-ranged weapon?	Yes. Your accuracy is reduced, but not your damage. If you have 2 fatigue tokens though, that crew will do zero damage on a miss.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2676516/can-you-assign-damage-to-any-character-from-a-end	Can a active captain  pick who will get the hit from each monster?	If you play with a friend and are captain this turn, makes sure you assign damage to his crew. It is a coop game, so you should mutually decide where the damage goes. However, the active player does have the final word in case of a disagreement. All the damage has to go to the same crew member (until they reach zero health, in which case all the remainder goes to another crew, etc.), but statuses can be assigned elsewhere.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2834346/command-tokens-in-combat	You're probably talking about activating adventure cards that provide extra aim or shields? Yes, I believe you can pay command to activate that during another player's combat turn.	I don’t think so. Combat is way more restrictive on spending command on other players attacks and being attacked than other situations. And pooling command is also impossible.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035945/can-damage-from-an-adventure-card-be-distributed-i	Can damage from an adventure card be distributed in a non-adjacent manner, or does it follow the rules for damage done by players?	All damage from the same attack must be placed adjacently (Rulepop Attack Reference), so it will have to follow the placement rules.However, adventure cards can be used 'anytime,' so it is a separate attack and doesn't have to be adjacent to other damage a character does, and can even be used before a character attacks (e.g. it can be used to disable an enemy's First Strike before anyone even attacks).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596709/combat-what-does-level-mean	Combat: What does level mean?	"In the rule book there is a section near back that states difficulty levels for monsters. 16 is medium I believe. Each enemy also has its own ""level"", the encounter level is the sum of each enemy's level that is participating in that fight. It's a quick way for you to know how hard the fight will be before you choose that option (if you have a choice)"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598795/what-rooms-for-ship-damage	What rooms for ship damage?	When instructed to take ship damage, draw 1 ability card per damage, then place a cube on the room(s) with a matching fate number. Each ship room can only take 2 damage and the hull can take 1 damage. If a room already has 2 damage, you may choose where to place the damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	Can you do the challenge without choosing any crew member to participate in it?	You can do the challenge even without choosing any crew member to participe in it ; so you would have had to try the challenge again and automatically lose it, which would have make you lose more health. When you fail a challenge and lose health but no crew member was participating, you chose how you want to dispatch the damages between your crew members, so the two remaining would have also died at some point	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2626309/exploring-towns	Are you allowed to read all the choices before you decide which one(s) you wish to select?	Yes you can read all the choices and no you don't have to do then in any order. But you can't repeat any on the same turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2604720/enemy-cards-clarification	Why is the body empty? Does that mean I can still put a damage on there in order to get to an adjacent spot?	"The body is empty because damage must be applied in a continuous ""swipe,"" so it makes it more difficult to swipe those effects away. You're allowed to place markers in the blanks, they're just effort/damage sinks, in a manner of speaking. Game mechanics wise, it's empty to present a puzzle of how to mark off all the hearts. Canonically, the explanation might be something like this enemy's body isn't an important part to incapacitate them. Yes, you can put a damage in any box, even if empty, and may have to when trying to reach other more important boxes."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661731/event-card-explanation	Can you help me understand this card? Can I instantly do the challenge and discard it? When you do the action, is the effect of the card active? I mean when I do the 6 savvy and I draw fate for the final result, should I gain -1 health and 1 weakened? Is this action replaces the one of the two actions I have to do on my turn?	You have to use one of the 2 actions every player gets each turn after the event phase. If challenge is failed, the second action can also be used for that. Until someone succeeds in that challenge, anytime you a fate card shows a 1, the crew suffer the effect listed. Remember that -1 Health and Weakened can go to different crew members, which is decided by the active player. You leave this card face up next to your shipboard and it remains in effect until then. You do not have to do it that specific turn. You can do it on a later turn as well, but will continue suffering the effects.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594416/adjacent-regen-question	"If a monster gets killed, but adjacent monster triggers the ""Regenerate adjacent"" ability, does it revive the killed monster? Does the revived monster also deal damage to the player characters?"	"A defeated enemy should be immediately removed from the array, and any remaining enemy cards should be moved closer together to get rid of the gap (if one was left). Because of this, it's not possible for a defeated enemy to still be ""adjacent"" to any of the other enemies."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2960501/travel	Can effects that change the chance to hit be used after you reveal fate?	Yes: From page 23: “After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy.” Are you referring to this or another type of effect?	“After you draw, you may use adventure card and crew board abilities that add to accuracy.”
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	When I place a command token on a character ability to activate it, how long does that stay active?	All abilities, whether they are from character boards, adventure cards or the small cards (can't remember their name) are one time use. So, if you block one damage using an ability, you block a single damage for the cost of 1 command, that's it. No less, no more.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2798520/using-non-active-audrie-to-travel-need-to-pay-1-co	Let’s say I got an ability card with perception skill which gives you +2 accuracy (or +2 defense) when you discard it.If I’m playing with captain and I discard this equipped card to get +2 accuracy in combat, then can I get 1 plus damage as well? On the rule book it says ‘you may discard 1 equipped when you attack with this weapon’ but I’m not sure if it means I should discard the card when I’m dealing the damage or I can discard it anytime in a combat round. Also Am i allowed to discard equipped card more than 1 (2cards) at the same time?	You cannot discard a card for two things at the same time. If you discard your ability card for +2 accuracy, that's all you get. If you discard it to get +1 damage with the captain's rifle, that is all you get.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2595755/campaign-end-trigger	what actually triggers the end of a campaign?	The campaign usually ends when you've run through the event deck three times.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535322/primeval-pwhat-does-remove-1-fatigue-mean	What does remove 1 fatigue mean?	If you gain a 2nd fatigue, the character should have a total of 2 tokens. The second token is placed showing the side with the “2 tokens: -1 damage” face up to remind you that if you have two tokens, you deal -1 damage.So the Aft Deck action just lets you remove one token.	
 	Combat round end ability on level card: 1 defense. Does this apply to the team or only to this team member? And only if this team member has been damaged?	This card is specifically about the damage that enemies do at the end of a full combat round (so after all 4 combat token have been used, see step #2 in the Combat rulepop). If you assign some (or all) of this damage to the crewmember with that specific ability card, then that crewmember receives 1 less damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3005830/command-token-duration	Also, having venom in a solo game kinda sucks right, as every turn its one damage i assume.	With venom, “The crew member takes 1 damage at the start of each player’s turn.” So, the number of players doesn’t change anything.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2622592/playable-with-5-players	Playable with 5 players?	The ship actions are balanced for 1-4 players, but you could have a fifth player serve as game manager without any trouble.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2826471/when-do-adventure-cards-become-refreshed	Is the map provided in the game searchable?	Note that this map (pdf file) is searchable. Makes it easy to figure out what page a location is in.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2598795/what-rooms-for-ship-damage	When you spend command to activate an ability card, where does that token go?	When you spend command to activate an ability card, that token does not go on the card but directly back to the supply. That means that as long as that character's player has command points, they can keep activating that card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2711287/level-cards	Can any player spend command to activate an adventure card like Scoundrel's Gear to give +2 cunning during a challenge, or is only the active player allowed to do that?	Any player is allowed to spend command on Adventure Cards at any time, so we did allow any player to activate these during challenges.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879442/a-bunch-of-questions	Can you choose to do less than the designated amount of damage?	No	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3180845/event-card-deck	What six cards am I supposed to discard? 	You build the deck according to the instructions and discard the top 6 cards.  Discarding 6 cards is what happens when you DIE.If you didn't die then you don't discard the cards. Or when your ship has FULL Damage.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2594336/rule-questions	When an enemy makes its counter attack and does damage to the character that attacked the enemy, if there is extra damage does the active player choose one of their other characters to take the rest of the damage? If so, can the other character use their block to reduce some of that damage.	Yes, another character takes the remainder of the damage (doesn’t have to be yours). No, their block isn’t used.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3043563/strange-illness-event-does-it-apply-if-the-1-is-re	Strange Illness event - Does it apply if the 1 is rerolled?	"For things like this, I take that to mean when you draw/get affected by a fate of ""1"" you get the event. Re-rolling/re-drawing from the use of powers - you are literally ""changing your fate."" Whether it applies to a challenge, a combat roll, or something else your new result replaces the original draw like it never happened - so Strange Illness wouldn't activate. If you run out of re-draws and end on another 1, then you'd get the Strange Illness effect once (you wouldn't get it multiple times for all the 1's you rolled as part of the check)."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	Does the rulebook allow discarding two cards for two extra damage?	The rulebook (version 3.1) indicates you may discard 1 equipped savvy card to deal +1 damage, suggesting you cannot discard two cards for two extra damage. It seems to be a one-time effect per attack, not a 'per discard' effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3012264/omg-new-to-the-game-and-can-t-find-the-answer-in-t	What happens when a single crew member has no health left?	 They don't die, they just can't do anything. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health. Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3197600/few-questions	"The german rules after finishing the event deck say: ""after drawing the last card of the event deck, the active player ends his turn."" That would mean he skips the action phase completely. Is this true or is it an errata?"	This is correct. The special end-of-act event replaces the Event phase of the next player's turn (so no event card is drawn, you read the indicated passage in the book instead).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248892/when-i-do-an-ability-test-can-i-look-at-the-cards	When I do an ability test, can I look at the cards already used in advance, calculate the success probability more, and then draw the ability cards?	Yes, equipped and discarded ability cards are public so you can calculate the odds.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648879/question-about-story-1-spoiler-for-going-through-f	When it says restore health, that does include status tokens?	No it does not. When you restore all health, you do not remove fatigue or status tokens unless specifically instructed to do so.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2661898/instant-effect-on-ability-cards	Some ability cards like 'Cleaning' have the craft skill symbol and an instant effect of removing one low morale. I assume 'instant effect' means that the effect triggers when equipped but then the card only serves as another craft skill symbol. Correct?	Correct	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855483/exploring-while-traveling	Can Kasumi's redraw after 1 be applied to another crew member you control?	Yes correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2648805/a-few-basic-questions	Can I spend Command tokens on things such as Adventure cards in the middle of resolving a Ship Action? For example, when performing the Bridge Action - can I draw my ability card from it, use Gloria to draw two more, THEN perform the rest of the Bridge Action, removing the command token from Gloria?	Yes.  Each part of a Ship Action (draw cards, heal, gain Command, etc.) is discrete, and other things can be done in between.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3206341/where-does-the-captain-go	Where does the captain go?	"The active player is always the captain.There is a ""Captain"" marker that the active player can have each turn to help everyone remember who is the actual captain for the turn."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2881308/travel-challenges	Where is it stated in the rule book that there's a hand limit?	Page 6 in the rules: Hand Limit Each player has a hand limit of 3 ability cards. Whenever you draw new ability cards, after you have drawn, if you have more than 3 cards in hand, you must immediately discard until you have only 3 (you may choose which cards to discard)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	How and when does the game give command tokens to players?	You normally start the campaign with 1 command token per player, but every ship action location will give you some tokens. The only time you won't get any tokens is when there are none left in the bank.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2618958/splash-damage-vs-resist-discard-2-cards-for-extra	If you want to do splash damage against an enemy with resist, does that resist apply?	Yes, damage resistance applies whether the enemy is the primary target or receiving splash damage. Defense is ignored, and counter attack doesn't trigger, but other defensive abilities still modify the damage as it states whenever 'damage is dealt'. So, you'd need to do 2 splash damage to cover 1 space in this instance.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3244949/is-use-of-totem-cards-an-action-spoiler	Is use of Totem cards an action?	It is not an action. But it could only be taken inside a travel action.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2677204/search-token-question	In the rule book it says to apply any damage you find when you use the deck. Does this also apply to the low morale token with the coin? Or do you only apply damage? 	Yes, the designer has confirmed that somewhere - all negative consequences of all revealed tokens are applied, including low morale.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2790265/end-of-event-deck-procedure	So, if you succeed, do not restore crew health, is that correct?	That's correct.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	Any player can discard a card from their hand to give +1 of the corresponding skill during a challenge, even if it's not that player's turn and even if his characters are not involved in the challenge?	Correct. Any player can discard any number of ability cards with the corresponding icon to help. They do not need to be involved in the challenge.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	Final scoring, which cards?	Seems that Market cards (including starting Gloria etc.) are COUNTED for final scoring. Adventure cards are also gained through scenario book and are worth 2 points. Some of Adventure cards are Totems. Those are worth 4 points	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2879442/a-bunch-of-questions	Can you use the equipped, repair action ability card more than once a turn assuming you can pay the cost?	Yes, the command token does not stay on the card as for adventure cards	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2881308/travel-challenges	When doing a Travel action, do you have to complete hazard challenges if you are only passing through the area i.e. your Craft challenge lets you move 2 regions, landing you in a hazard-free region, but passing through a region with a hazard?	Yes, but if you fail you can keep moving through you just take the negative effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2779192/does-uncovering-end-of-round-abilities-regen-cause	Does uncovering end of round abilities (Regen) cause them to trigger?	"I would argue that ""activates at the end of each combat round"" implies immediately at the end of the round. Any other interpretation is reading into the rules and is not focusing on exactly what the rules are saying. As a result, I believe any ability uncovered will activate in the round that Adjacent Regen applies."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2855502/cooking-flapjacks-clarification-needed	"I see that the ""Flapjacks"" card has an ability to remove 3 x health tokens and 3 x fatigue tokens from a crew member. My question is, can I split that to heal one character while removing fatigue from another? Or does the card collectively apply to only one crew member?"	Fortunately for you, it's neither of those!  You can remove any 3 fatigue and damage tokens you'd like, from any characters and in any combination.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3083930/equipped-ability-cards-using-matching-symbols-to-a	After the ability card is drawn to determine fate for a CHALLENGE can any crew member, including those that have not participated in the challenge originally, spend a command token on an equipped ability card to boost the fate number by 1 if the symbol matches the challenge type?	Treat the symbols on any cards equipped to characters as if they were printed on the character board... they increase that characters stats. There is no need to spend command to activate those symbols.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844043/newb-questions	How do I assign damage in instances like this, where there has not been a challenge?	Yes, to any of the characters you control.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2838484/how-to-re-prepare-the-event-deck	When we finish the event deck and read the proper paragraph in the story book, it says to create a new event deck. Elsewhere in the rules, it says to discard 6 event cards. I'm confused about this. Since there are normally six mild event cards on top, if I have to discard six, why would I even bother shuffling the mild event cards?  Why doesn't the storybook say anything about discarding six cards?  On the 3rd time through, do I discard 12 cards?  What exactly is the proper procedure for re-preparing the event deck?	Should your crew of ship be defeated, that's when you discard 6 events cards. but not beyond the current event deck (i.o.w.: they don't carry over into a new event deck). In terms of rebuilding the event deck: we tend to set aside used events, and only build the deck with new 'fresh' events.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2610743/first-strike	"What does ""first strike,"" mean on an enemy and where is this in the rulebook?"	"Rule Book pg. 35, ""First Strike""This ability is active until disabled. Any time a crew member attacks this enemy, the enemy counterattacks first."

Can I spend that card's command cost when one of my crewmates is being hit to negate that much damage?	Yes. Actually, when anybody's crewmate is being hit I believe. With added benefit of being able to use this block for end of round attacks as well. Normal block found on weapons cannot be used this way.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2596731/questions-regarding-combat	So, then the grey combat cubes are gathered again, and given out to the players again, so on and so forth until the monsters are destroyed or the players die, right?	Right	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2849626/regular-challenges-vs-travel-challenges	Are any or all of these intended to be deviations from the normal challenge procedure?	Yes, the deviations are intended. For the Travel Action Craft challenge, other players cannot support you with their crew members, and there are specific rules about discarding ability cards and using crew and adventure cards.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3248832/if-the-enemy-counterattacks-after-failing-to-attac	If the enemy counterattacks after failing to attack, you can deal 1 damage to the enemy again. Even if the attack is successful, will the enemy counterattack and then deal 1 damage to the enemy again?	If the attack is successful, then you don't deal an additional damage. The additional damage is only if you miss on your attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537285/primeval-peril-discarding-ability-cards-wording	"If a card just says ""discard this card to..."" rather than ""discard this equipped card to..."" can it simple be discarded from your hand directly to trigger the effect?"	You're right, it should specify the equipped card but, you also must equipped an ability card to gain the ability hence if you don't have it equipped the ability text takes no effect.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3000221/clarifying-some-rules	Do characters die in battle?	The characters don't die but, according to the rules 'Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt'.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3001894/are-permanent-level-cards-removed-after-the-set-of	"After the 18 levels of one of the 3 runs, one needs to discard the pile of level cards and create a new stack of 6 mild/normal/heavy cards. If there are still permanent level cards (like ""gain a ship damage on every Fate 1 unless you solve a Strength 8""), will these be removed as well?"	Ongoing event cards (like the one you describe) remain after each run through of the event deck until you've run through the event deck 3 times and thus completed a campaign. Most of the ongoing event cards have actions on them that you can take either as one of your 2 actions or at the end of your turn to attempt to resolve them. Since they stick around when you make a new event deck, I find it's generally good to get rid of them relatively soon.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2798520/using-non-active-audrie-to-travel-need-to-pay-1-co	If the active player decides to Travel, and the non-active player agrees to have Audrie participate in the craft challenge, does the non-active player need to pay 1 command, as would be the case in a normal (i.e., non-Travel) challenge?	Yes they would need to pay 1 command and place a fatigue on Audrie.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3047439/who-can-be-targeted-by-some-ability-card-abilities	Who can be targeted by some Ability Card abilities?	Abilities on ability cards generally only apply to the crew member to which they are equipped unless otherwise specified on the card.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2625329/event-deck-depletion-spoilers	When an event Deck is depleted and it's the next person's turn, instead of drawing an event card, you turn to entry 1 in the storybook. Does that person first get to take a ship action?	You complete that person's turn then turn to entry 1. After completing the actions of entry 1, it is the next player's turn.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597321/challenge-discard-ability-card-require-participati	Can you only add skill to your own crew members, or any crew members?

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	Means, 2 of my available skills were not active? Which of them is chosen by me? Or are they depending on my current necessary skills like savvy in my actual challenge?	it means all skills count as 2 points lower when making a skill check.so if you had 3 savvy, it would only add +1, not +3 in a savvy check.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2991132/ability-and-level-cards-also-skills-on-crew-boards	After going thru the 18 event cards, the story rules say to discard all equipped ability cards. Do you shuffle the ability deck at that point?	They are discarded but you’re not instructed to shuffle. So no, you have to wait till the deck runs out. There are multiple copies of each card though I believe.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2893834/search-token-low-morale	Which test? I did not performed any test. I was just in the ship action (deck).	It means you found 1 coin and 1 character gets low morale.Since you are playing solo, you can assign low morale to any of your characters.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2851199/spoiler-starting-the-second-campaign	At the end of our ordeal, we were instructed to place Laurent back in game box. Will we get him back again at the start of the second run?	Correct. You will get all characters (including Laurent) back at the beginning of each campaign.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2862650/gregory-synergy	Can you give the synergy to a crew who has already hit 0 to bring them back, or must this be on a crew at the time they hit 0 in order to activate?	No, from the wording of the synergy token in the rulebook, it's when the crew member hits 0. It's too late if they already are. I use this as protection usually for a crew member that's low on health, but a heavy hitter. Where they would be reduced to zero after an attack, if they have Gregory's synergy token they use it so as not to be defeated and possibly make another (victorious) attack.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2919349/can-you-use-adventure-cards-and-crew-abilities-if	Can you use adventure cards and crew abilities if they have command tokens on them?	You cannot use crew abilities (any) or normal ability cards if they have command one them. The command would need to be cleared first.A weapon typically does not have an ability like an ability card and does not get command on it. You can recognise that by the command icon (the blue token).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Should a fate card  always be drawn for every challenge?	Yes, you should draw fate for every challenge, even if there is small or no chance that you'll complete it successfully.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3037407/some-questions-before-i-start	Are Ability/Adventure cards a 1 time use? or are they reusable?	Depends on the card and how you use it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2809276/your-crew-members	Does this mean the crew members I control, or any member on the table?	"Context is important, but it normally means the crew which one player controls. For example, Rulepop says: ""If an ability description says “you,” it means the player that controls the crew member to which the card is equipped."" Was there a specific use case or rulebook sentence to which you were referring?"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2597649/combat-damage-stacking	If there is a damage token in the middle of the enemy card and I wanted to place 3 damage...can I place damage to the right and left of the middle square and then one damage is nullified because of the middle square already containing damage?	You cannot cover damage that has already been covered. You have to go around it.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2659537/list-of-ability-card-questions-and-answers	A crew member attacks, misses, then resolves damage first due to the Rapid Strike ability. During the damage resolution, I discard Rapid Strike to get +1 damage. Does the damage still get applied first?	Yes. Once you’re in the “apply damage” phase, you can use various abilities and discard cards, but it won’t modify what combat step you’re in.

Do you also mark a defeat and move to port?	Yes, you do the same thing. You do not have to repeat 1 or 1.1, but just move on with the campaign. Don't forget to discard the top 6 cards of the newly formed deck. Or rather do not even bother adding the 6 easy events to the top.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2537003/travel-and-hazard	Hello.If there is a Hazard in the first space I enter, can I travel more than 1 space after I resolve the challenge, no matter if I win or lose it ?	I reckon you can, rules don't say anything about this, the only thing is that if you enter a hazard space you must complete the hazard’s challenge or take negative consequences (and you always draw fate even if you decide not to fatigue anybody), after that you can take the remaining movement.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2995206/weapon-says-gain-low-morale-when-used	If my weapon says when used gain low morale, does this apply to the weapon holder and the weapon is unusable if they have low morale, or can the low morale be given to a different crew member when using the weapon?	"If it's just the Low Morale symbol, you can give it to anyone.  If it says ""This Crew Member"" it has to be the one using the weapon.  You can play it either way.  I would justify it as either the weapon makes the user feel like it's stealing their soul so they gain low morale.  OR. if another character gains the Low Morale, that crew member can be terrified of the other crew members power.  Kinda like Sam watching Frodo fall to the power of the ring."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2658768/hunting-serpent-action	"Has this been confirmed somewhere by the designer? It makes sense in theory, but the rules don't say anything about your 2 turn ""actions"" being open to anything other than the 4 ones on the ship board."	"Yes, any event card that has the word ""action"" on it requires you to use one of your actions to resolve it."	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2721403/synergy-tokens-on-a-miss	Say I attack with the captain who has another crewmember's +1 damage synergy token. I miss. Therefore, I take the counterattack from the monster and then normally am allowed to deal one damage. Can I use the synergy token to add damage, even though I missed?	"Yes, you can. The rule says: ""Missing: If you miss, you still get to deal 1 damage, after the enemy counterattack (you deal 0 damage in this case if you have 2 fatigue). Abilities that increase attack damage can be used even if you miss.""You can check a particular rule quickly in this awesome online guide: https://rulepop.com/sleeping-gods/#attack-counterattack"	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601453/resolution-of-event-cards	Just learning the game and going through the walkthrough. I drew the event card ‘Maintenance’ which would allow to repair 1 ship damage. In such a case as not having damage is it okay to bypass resolving the event? This makes me wonder if other cards would have similar situations where they would make no difference if you were to attempt it. Can you ignore cards in such circumstances?	If an event card has only one challenge listed, you cannot skip it. You'd just not get a reward in this case.(updated rulebook, version 3.1)	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2615332/clarification-on-accuracy-crew-ability	when you utilize Laurent's ability to increase his accuracy how long does it last?	Yes, it only lasts for one combat check, and it can only be used when Laurent attacks. You can activate it after drawing fate though... so it's typically emergency use when you need one more point of accuracy to hit.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Can another player discard Craft Ability Cards from their hand to boost the total?	Since travel is a CRAFT Challenge I assume another player can discard Abilities cards to boost the total.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2894053/duplicating-actionsabilities	Can I equip a single crew member with two identical ability cards? For example, can one crew member have two Bandages cards?	Yes	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	If no crew member was chosen to fatigue and the challenge is failed, how is it determined which crew member suffers the consequences?	Anyone who participated takes consequences first, otherwise you choose who takes the consequences. You can split up damage between crew members how you like.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2565907/primeval-perilsleeping-gods-rules-clarifications	Do credits from previous achievements carry over in subsequent campaigns?	Credits from previous achievements do not carry over but functionally are locked out: you are expected to avoid previously obtained totems.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3129703/exhausted-event-decks-after-era-1-what-happens-aft	Should you write down keywords even if it doesn't make thematic sense?	It depends on the player's preference. Some players choose not to write down keywords if it doesn't make thematic sense to them, preferring to keep the gameplay more in line with the story's logic. Others write them down regardless, focusing on the gameplay mechanic rather than the thematic aspect. It's a matter of personal choice and how it affects your enjoyment of the game.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3164921/final-scoring-which-cards	What happens if no crew member participates in the challenge?	If no crew member participates in the challenge, you only look at the fate number on the card but don't apply any bonus you would have gained from a crew member	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2735968/official-solo-rules	What is the main cost of repeated spaces like this?	The main cost of repeated spaces like this is just an opportunity cost. If you're taking extra turns to re-do that one spot for the rewards, then you're not spending turns exploring new locations which potentially might have higher numbers of rewards. But unless there's a keyword blocking you, you are allowed to repeat locations.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2844304/assigning-command-tokensadventure-card-resources	Can I assign my personal command tokens to another players crew member in order to activate their crew abilities or cards, or are players only able to assign command tokens on their OWN crew members/cards?	You can only use crew board abilities of crew members under your control	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2841162/possible-to-re-gain-a-completed-quest	This is also covered in the rules for Quest Cards:	When the storybook says “Lose quest x,” or “Complete quest x,” place the specified card in the used quest box. Once quests are in this box, you cannot retrieve them (unless you are resetting the game for a new campaign).	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2785424/crew-board-ability-use-in-combat-dead-character	can I utilize a crew members board ability when they themselves are passed out?	You can use abilities till the end of the combat round, but can't participate in combat thereafter.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2532476/primevil-peril-event-effects-one-or-all-characters	Just to clarify, if the Captain has 2 Strength (including equipped abilities), I only get the +2 Strength if I put a fatigue on the Captain. But, if the Captain has the equipped ability Bold Attempt (discard to redraw fate), I could still use the ability even if the Captain did not spend fatigue to participate in the challenge, right? Also, if I did spend fatigue and the Captain gave +2 Strength, and then I discarded Bold Attempt to redraw fate, then now the Captain only contributes +1 Strength, right?	Still count the strength since the draw comes after having already decided to use the crew member.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3045240/careful-aim-ability-card	"Anyone with an English copy who can check what the text on the ability card ""Careful Aim"" says?"

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2668301/ongoing-events-and-reset-of-the-event-deck	Is there any reason to hope that my ongoing events go away after resetting the event deck? Or do I still have to deal with them?	The rules tell you how to handle this at the top of page 11. There should be instructions on the card to tell you how to get rid of it, or when the card expires.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2535700/weakened-status	I haven't played much yet. How do you remove status effects? Do you have to find it in the game or is it a rule I've missed?	"The rulebook mentions statuses can be removed by character abilities and adventure cards. For example, pg. 34 says, ""Remove Status: This can be used to remove status from any crew member"" when referring to general crew abilities. The particular ability and adventure card will specify what it removes."	Remove Status: This can be used to remove status from any crew member

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2605333/enemy-end-of-round-damage	Which of these statements is correct:A) Since all the damage must go to one crew member, I could choose Audrie, apply 1 damage token and ignore the rest. (I know this isn't correct but it is a logical possibility from the wording above).B) I assign one damage to Audrie and give 6 damage to Rafael.C) I am forced to choose Rafael because only he has the capacity to absorb 7 damage tokens (since all damage must be assigned to a single crew member).I think that (B) is the correct answer but I want to make sure my interpretation is correct.	B) is correctThis is stated clearly on page 24 of the most recent rules, found on RRG website.  It’s the last bullet in the same section of that same page.“If a crew member runs out of health while taking damage, any remaining damage must be dealt to another crew member, and so on.”(...it chains if a lot of damage is dealt).

Does this mean this takes a full actual 'Action', i.e. replacing one usual action amongst the 'Travel/Explore/Market/Harbour'?"	Yes. This is what makes it a real pain to deal with	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3080154/questions-about-ship-action-order-and-other-player	Travel - can you travel using a crew member of another player?	Since travel is a CRAFT Challenge (but with a maximum of one crew member committed), I assume another player can pay a Command to use one of their crew members.	
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2866449/adventure-card-88-clarification-spoiler	Can you do this outside of combat to set this up ahead of time, or only once combat has commenced?	Not a good idea, as setting up combat places each character's synergy token back on their own board.
