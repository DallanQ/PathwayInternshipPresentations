A campaign takes around 10-20 hours to complete, so if you have a dedicated space to keep the game set up, you do not need to save the game.\\n\\nTo save the game and pack up mid-campaign, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. On the next available line on your journey sheet, write down your ship's location, the ship's current damage, and the last ship action that was used. Also write down which ability cards each player has in their hand, and how many unspent command tokens they have.\\n\\n2. Place each crew board and all associated damage, status tokens, ability cards, level cards, and equipped weapons in a separate crew plastic bag. Place these in storage box 1 (see pg. 2).\\n\\n3. Place all of your resources, coins, adventure cards, ability cards in hand, unused command tokens you own, and quest cards in the campaign box. When placing adventure cards in this box, put them in their own bag, and put any that have command tokens on them face down in the pile. Place the current event deck in this box as well.\\n\\n4. Place the ability card draw deck in a plastic bag. Place the ability card discard pile face up in the bag (keep the draw deck face down). Indicate the bottom of this pile by placing a synergy token at the bottom.\\n\\n5.

Each crew member can hold up to 2 fatigue tokens.\\n\\nEach fatigue token is double-sided. If a crew member has only 1 token, place the blank side face up. If a crew member has a 2nd fatigue token, it should have the \"-1 damage\" side face up. This causes the crew member to deal -1 damage in combat.\\n\\nA crew member with 2 fatigue tokens cannot participate in challenges (pg. 19), but can continue to participate in combat (pg. 21).\\n\\nYou can remove fatigue mainly by cooking recipes or performing a port action.\\n\\nHealth (page 8)\\n\\nHealth is the amount of damage a crew member can take and still function normally. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health. Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt.\\n\\nIf all crew members have 0 health, you are defeated (see \"Defeat\" on pg. 28).\\n\\nA crew member's damage cannot exceed their health‚Äîany excess must be placed on another crew member.</td>\n",

Apply the effects until you're able to discard the card. (The way to discard the card is described on each card.)\\n\\n- You cannot ignore an event card.

Each time you reach the end of the event deck, follow these instructions:\\n\\nTurn Overview (page 10)\\n\\nThis is a summary of the steps you take on your turn. The steps are explained in detail on pgs. 10-16.\\n\\nStarting with the first player, players take turns in clockwise order. Follow these steps on your turn:\\n\\n1. Ship Action: Choose a ship action. Move the ship action figure to one of the five ship rooms and apply the effect. You must move the ship action figure to a new room each turn (you cannot repeat the same room two turns in a row). (See pg. 10-11.)\\n\\n2. Event: Draw an event card and read the effect. Events may present a choice, a challenge, consequence, or other effect. (For challenges, see pg. 19.) Resolve the event card before continuing your turn. (For event card rules, see pg. 12.)\\n\\n3. Two Actions: Perform two actions. Available actions are listed on the bottom of the ship board. You may perform the same action twice in one turn. These actions are explained starting on pg. 13.\\n\\n4. End of Turn: After you have performed your two actions, pass the captain token to the player on the left. That player now starts their turn.</td>\n",

To remove a player, reassign crew members evenly, and the leaving player must discard 1 ability card and all but 1 command token.

       "22b77a335508da37  Saving the Game (page 31)\\n\\nAt the start of any player's turn, you can decide to stop playing and save your game. You only need to do this if you want to pack up the game. This is simply a way to keep track of your progress so you can continue another time. A campaign takes around 10-20 hours to complete, so if you have a dedicated space to keep the game set up, you do not need to save the game.\\n\\nTo save the game and pack up mid-campaign, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. On the next available line on your journey sheet, write down your ship's location, the ship's current damage, and the last ship action that was used. Also write down which ability cards each player has in their hand, and how many unspent command tokens they have.\\n\\n2. Place each crew board and all associated damage, status tokens, ability cards, level cards, and equipped weapons in a separate crew plastic bag. Place these in storage box 1 (see pg. 2).\\n\\n3. Place all of your resources, coins, adventure cards, ability cards in hand, unused command tokens you own, and quest cards in the campaign box. When placing adventure cards in this box, put them in their own bag, and put any that have command tokens on them face down in the pile. Place the current event deck in this box as well.\\n\\n4. Place the ability card draw deck in a plastic bag. Place the ability card discard pile face up in the bag (keep the draw deck face down). Indicate the bottom of this pile by placing a synergy token at the bottom.\\n\\n5. Clean up the rest of the game components.\\n\\nAdding & Removing Players (page 33)\\n\\nYou can add or remove players at the end of any turn.\\n\\nFollow these steps to add a player:\\n\\n1. After the current turn ends, split up crew boards and assign them to each player as evenly as possible (except Captain Odessa, who is always controlled by the active player).\\n\\nFollow these steps to remove a player:\\n\\n1. After the current turn ends, reassign crew members to players as evenly as possible (except Captain Odessa, who is always controlled by the active player).\\n\\n2. The player that is leaving must discard 1 ability card and all of their command but 1. The active player decides how to distribute the remaining cards and command token to the other players.\\n\\nNOTE: Remember to turn the ship board to the correct side depending on the number of players in the game.  \n",

Each crew member can hold up to 2 fatigue tokens.\\n\\nEach fatigue token is double-sided. If a crew member has only 1 token, place the blank side face up. If a crew member has a 2nd fatigue token, it should have the \"-1 damage\" side face up. This causes the crew member to deal -1 damage in combat.\\n\\nA crew member with 2 fatigue tokens cannot participate in challenges (pg. 19), but can continue to participate in combat (pg. 21).\\n\\nYou can remove fatigue mainly by cooking recipes or performing a port action.\\n\\nHealth (page 8)\\n\\nHealth is the amount of damage a crew member can take and still function normally. If a crew member has damage equal to their health (known as having 0 health), they can no longer attack, participate in challenges, or activate any of their crew board abilities or ability cards until they regain at least 1 health. Thematically, at 0 health they are nearly unconscious, able to speak and move, but badly hurt.\\n\\nIf all crew members have 0 health, you are defeated (see \"Defeat\" on pg. 28).\\n\\nA crew member's damage cannot exceed their health‚Äîany excess must be placed on another crew member.  \n",

Event (page 12)\\n\\nDraw the top card of the event deck and read it aloud. Apply the effect or complete the challenge.\\n\\n- Some event cards have multiple choices. In this case, choose one and apply the effect.\\n\\n- If you draw an event card with the word \"ongoing,\" place it face up near the ship board. Apply the effects until you're able to discard the card. (The way to discard the card is described on each card.)\\n\\n- You cannot ignore an event card. If it only has 1 challenge listed, you must complete it.\\n\\nOver the course of each campaign, you will go through the event deck 3 times. Each time you reach the end of the event deck, follow these instructions:\\n\\nTurn Overview (page 10)\\n\\nThis is a summary of the steps you take on your turn. The steps are explained in detail on pgs. 10-16.\\n\\nStarting with the first player, players take turns in clockwise order. Follow these steps on your turn:\\n\\n1. Ship Action: Choose a ship action. Move the ship action figure to one of the five ship rooms and apply the effect. You must move the ship action figure to a new room each turn (you cannot repeat the same room two turns in a row). (See pg. 10-11.)\\n\\n2. Event: Draw an event card and read the effect. Events may present a choice, a challenge, consequence, or other effect. (For challenges, see pg. 19.) Resolve the event card before continuing your turn. (For event card rules, see pg. 12.)\\n\\n3. Two Actions: Perform two actions. Available actions are listed on the bottom of the ship board. You may perform the same action twice in one turn. These actions are explained starting on pg. 13.\\n\\n4. End of Turn: After you have performed your two actions, pass the captain token to the player on the left. That player now starts their turn.  "

Also write down which ability cards each player has in their hand, and how many unspent command tokens they have.\\n\\n2.

If a crew member has a 2nd fatigue token, it should have the \"-1 damage\" side face up. This causes the crew member to deal -1 damage in combat.\\n\\nA crew member with 2 fatigue tokens cannot participate in challenges (pg. 19), but can continue to participate in combat (pg. 21).\\n\\nYou can remove fatigue mainly by cooking recipes or performing a port action.   \n",
